## Introduction

This page provides further guidance on different types of courses you can build using The WAI-Curricula resource. In addition, it offers an estimated duration for each of them based on their type and format.

## Types of Courses

### University Course

Courses at university use to translate their duration into a credit system. There are several of such systems around the world, for example, the ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System) and the American Credit System. One ECTS credit corresponds to 25-30 hours of students' workload, and 60 credits reflect a complete year of work.

The below is an estimate of how many ECTS credits will be advised for [Module 1: Introduction to Web Accessibility](/curricula/introduction-to-web-accessibility/) for a whole semester.

| Title | European CREDITS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit 1: What is Web Accessibility | 6 |
| Topic: Stories of People with Disabilities | 4 |
| Topic: Scope of Web Accessibility | 2 |
| Unit 2: People and Digital Technology | 6 |
| Topic: Diverse Abilities, Tools, and Barriers | 4 |
| Topic: Components of Web Accessibility | 2 |
| Unit 3: Business Case and Benefits | 6 |
| Topic: Benefits of Accessibility | 6 |
| Unit 4: Principles, Guidelines and Checks | 6 |
| Topic: Principles of Web Accessibility | 2 |
| Topic: Guidelines and Other Standards | 2 |
| Topic: First Checks for Web Accessibility | 2 |
| Unit 5: Applying and Managing Accessibility | 6 |
| Topic: Planning and Managing Web Accessibility | 1.5 |
| Topic: Developing Policies and Statements | 1.5 |
| Topic: Roles and Responsibilities | 1.5 |
| Topic: Accessibility in an Existing Project | 1.5 |
| Total | 30 |
 
 
### Consultancy Agency Course

Consultancy courses need to determine how much time they will be devoting to a particular subject, what audience they will address and how they will teach the contents (online / classroom). The following is an estimate for a one week course on web accessibility.

| Title | Duration (days) |
| --- | --- |
| Unit 1: What is Web Accessibility | 1 |
| Topic: Stories of People with Disabilities | 0.7 |
| Topic: Scope of Web Accessibility | 0.3 |
| Unit 2: People and Digital Technology | 1 |
| Topic: Diverse Abilities, Tools, and Barriers | 0.6 |
