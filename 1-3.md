### Topic: Accessibility as a Drive for Innovation

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain how accessibility helps organizations remove architectural, digital, and social barriers. Use the resource [Business Case for Digital Accessibility (Drive Innovation)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#drive-innovation)

### Learning Outcomes

* Identify the common features of accessibility and usability to deliver a more intuitive experience.
* Explain how some innovative products which were originally developed for people with disabilities, are now used by all
* Identify how accessibility contributes for more human-centered design interaction patterns.

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30 to 45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Discuss how accessibility solutions are also enjoyed by many people regardless of their disability. Emphasize how many solutions originally thought for accessibility have become mainstream, such as the type-writer, telephone, punch cards, text to speech, email, and voice controls.
* Promote discussion among students about which aspects of accessibility benefit them as well as people with disabilities. For instance, ask them which products they can use without looking at them or without pressing any button on them.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to research how accessibility benefits many people with and without disabilities in their organization or local environment. Emphasize that statistics on this matter are difficult to find and interpret. The concept of disability, the way it is measured in different cultures, and the right for people not to disclose their disabilities may influence the results.
* Encourage students to research for publicly available testimonials about business cases for accessibility. Advise them that accuracy of such testimonials might not be easily determined and further research might be needed.

### Topic: Broader Benefits of Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce other benefits of accessibility, such as technical or financial. Use the resource [Developing an Accessibility Business Case for your Organization (Archived)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/).

#### Learning Outcomes

* Explain how accessibility can enhance the brand perception and contribute to some other benefits related to CSR
* Identify how accessibility benefits interoperability when serving content in different environments and settings
* Explain how accessibility helps build high-quality products by meeting technical standards
* Identify accessibility as an opportunity to increase the use of products
* Explain how accessibility implementations help reduce overall development costs  

#### Teaching Ideas 

* Give examples of accessible pages and ask students to browse them in different combinations of devices and screen sizes. Contrast them with inaccessible examples. Emphasize how the overall experience is better in accessible pages.
* Reflect with students about how accessibility can reduce development time if implemented from the beginning, e.g., when changing presentational aspects of a page. Contrast the amount of time it takes to make such changes in an accessible and in an inaccessible site.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to perform a specific task with their smart assistant built-in to their mobile phones. Point students to general questions such as asking for the news, querying how the weather is like, or checking how many items they have in their shopping list. 
* Ask students to research on users with disabilities that could be potentially benefited if accessibility is implemented in their organization. Encourage them to elaborate on the business opportunity that organizations have when implementing accessibility.

### Topic: Minimizing Legal Risk

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Emphasize on success cases from organizations that have implemented accessibility into their products. Underline how that contributes to avoiding legal risks. Use the resource [The Business Case for Digital Accessibility (Minimize Legal Risk)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#minimize-legal-risk)

#### Learning Outcomes

* Describe some potential risks of not addressing accessibility.
* Identify some international, regional, and local accessibility standards and policies

#### Teaching Ideas

* Engage students in a conversation about how they could improve access to information for people with disabilities.
* Ask students to identify which policies may apply to their organizations. Go through the [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](https://www.w3.org/wai/policies/) resource.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to research on the  [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) Encourage them to share with their colleagues the conception that it offers about people with disabilities. Concentrate on the right to access to information found in article 9.
* Ask students to research if there are legal requirements with regard to accessibility for their organization. If so, ask them to summarize the main aspects they include.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

## Ideas for Assessment

* Develop potential business case arguments for their own organization, and present this to other learners as examples of how they can apply what they have learned.
