### Topic: Accessibility as a Driver for Innovation

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain the innovation behind different accessibility features. Provide examples of how accessibility features are increasingly becoming mainstream, for example in mobile phones and applications. Explain the impact of accessibility in improving usability for all users. Use examples and background from the resource [Business Case for Digital Accessibility (Drive Innovation)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#drive-innovation).

### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:
* List examples of accessibility features and explain the innovative benefits for people in different situatons.
* Identify common aspects between accessibility and usability, and how they deliver more intuitive experiences.
* Explain how accessibility encourages human-centered design approaches, which result in more usable products.

#### Duration

Approximately 30 to 45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Discuss how accessibility features benefit many people in different situations, such as mobile phone users, older people, and people using different hardware. Explain that many features originally thought for accessibility have become mainstream, such as the type-writer, telephone, punch cards, text to speech, email, and voice controls.
* Promote discussion among students about which accessibility features they may already be using and which they may want to use. For example, ask them if they have used voice to dictate or to listen to messages.
* Provide analogies between digital accessibility, and social and architectural accessibility. For example, relate digital accessibility to the curb cut on sidewalk, which benefits people using strollers, bicycles, pushing carts, carrying luggage, etc. This concept is sometimes referred to as the electronic curb cut.

#### Homework Ideas

* Students search for publicly available accessibility testimonials and business case arguments from different organizations. Advise student that testimonials are often not be easy to verify and may require further analysis.
* Students research and describe different mainstream accessibility features that they are already using, for example on their mobile phone, or accessibility features that they may want to use in the future.

### Topic: Broader Benefits of Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the broader benefits of accessibility, such as ehancing brand reputation, increasing market reach, and demonstrating social responsibility. Provide examples of organizations that have adopted accessibility and explain the broader benefits that result for these organizations. Use the resource [Business Case for Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/). Additional technical and financial factors are described in the resource [Developing an Accessibility Business Case for your Organization (Archived)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:
* Explain how accessibility can enhance brand reputation and help demonstrate social responsibility.
* Explain how accessibility helps build high-quality products by meeting technical standards.
* Explain how accessibility implementations can help reduce overall development and maintenance costs.
* List examples of organizations that have adopted accessibility, and the benefits these organizations report.

#### Teaching Ideas 

* Introduce case studies of organizations who have adopted accessibility. Explain the benefits that resulted from that, such as improved brand reputation from working together more closely with their stakeholders to improve accessibility.
* Give examples of accessible pages and ask students to browse them in different combinations of devices and screen sizes. Contrast them with inaccessible examples. Emphasize how the overall experience is better in accessible pages.
* Reflect with students about how accessibility can reduce development time if implemented from the beginning, e.g., when changing presentational aspects of a page. Contrast the amount of time it takes to make such changes in an accessible and in an inaccessible page.

#### Homework Ideas

* Students perform a specific task with the smart assistant built-in to their mobile phones. For example, students read the news, query the weather, or check items into a shopping cart. 
* Students research how an organization could benefit from improving accessibility implementation. Encourage the students to elaborate on specific business opportunities of the organization from implementing accessibility.

### Topic: Minimizing Legal Risk

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain legal requirements relevant to the users, for example national and regional policies. Outline the increasing uptake internationally, including in the [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html). If possible, provide some examples of legal incidences with specific organizations. Use the resource [The Business Case for Digital Accessibility (Minimize Legal Risk)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#minimize-legal-risk).

#### Learning Outcomes

* Describe the rationale and need for accessibility laws and policies.
* Describe some potential risks of not addressing accessibility.
* Identify some international, regional, and local accessibility policies.

#### Teaching Ideas

* Engage students in a conversation about non-discrimination and equal rights. Ask students to think of specific examples of non-discrimination, such as access to education, employment, civic participation, culture, and leisure.
* Ask students to identify which policies may apply to a particular type of organizations. The resource [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](https://www.w3.org/wai/policies/) lists some examples internationally.

#### Homework Ideas

* Students study article 9, right to access to information, of the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) and share with fellow students their understanding of the core concepts of that article for people with disabilities. 
* Students research if there are accessibility laws and policies applicable to an organization of their choice. Students summarize the main implications relevant to the organization.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

## Ideas for Assessment

* Multiple choice: List of business case arguments, each with choices of different benefits; students select the benefits that match the corresponding business case arguments.
* Presentation: Students present to other students business case arguments that are applicable to an organization of their choice and explain the rationale for each argument.
