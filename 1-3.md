### Topic: Benefits of Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the benefits of accessibility, such as enhancing brand reputation, increasing market reach, demonstrating social responsibility, and minimizing legal risk. Provide examples of organizations that have adopted accessibility and explain the broader benefits that result for these organizations. For foundations on these aspects, refer to [The Business Case for Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* List examples of organizations that have adopted accessibility, and the benefits these organizations report.
* List examples of accessibility features and explain how they also benefit people without disabilities.
* Explain how accessibility can enhance brand reputation and help demonstrate social responsibility.
* Explain how accessibility implementations can help reduce overall maintenance and remediation costs.
* Explain how accessibility can promote human-centered design approaches, which result in more usable products.
* Describe some potential risks of not addressing accessibility, such as possible lawsuits and costly litigations.

#### Teaching Ideas 

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Introduce case studies of organizations who have adopted accessibility. Explain the benefits that resulted from that, such as improved brand reputation from working together more closely with their stakeholders to improve accessibility.
* Reflect about how accessibility can reduce design and development time if implemented from the beginning, e.g., when selecting a specific CMS for a project. Contrast the amount of time it takes to implement accessibility depending on CMS support.
* Provide analogies between digital accessibility, and social and architectural accessibility. For example, relate digital accessibility to curb cuts in sidewalks that benefit people with strollers, carts, luggage, bicycles, etc.
* Discuss how accessibility features benefit many people in different situations, such as mobile phone users, older people, and people using different hardware. Explain that many features originally designed for accessibility have become mainstream, such as text to speech, voice controls, captions, etc.
* Promote discussion among students about which accessibility features they are familiar with. For example, ask them if they have used voice to dictate or to listen to messages. Elaborate on how these features improve overall user experience.
* Explain legal requirements relevant to some organizations, for example, national and regional policies. Outline the increasing uptake internationally, including in the [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html).
* If possible, provide some examples of legal incidences with organizations in your region. If it is not possible, you can use examples from [The Business Case for Digital Accessibility (Minimize Legal Risk)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#minimize-legal-risk).
* Refer to specific legal cases related to accessibility and present their settlements or outcomes. Find litigation cases that were both upheld as well as dismissed to determine the reasons for the outcome and explore why the plaintiff brought the case.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to assess the learning outcomes:

* Practice &mdash; Students perform a specific task with the virtual assistant in their mobile phones. For example, students read the news, query the weather, or check items into a 
shopping cart. Assess students' capacity to recognize innovation behind features originally design for accessibility that many people use nowadays.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students research how an organization could benefit from improving accessibility implementation. Assess students' capacity to elaborate on business opportunities derived from implementing accessibility.
* Presentation &mdash; Students research and describe different mainstream accessibility features that they are already using, for example on their mobile phone, or accessibility features that they may want to use in the future. Assess students' capacity to identify  accessibility features that others can enjoy.
* Report &mdash; Students write a report of around 200 words about publicly-available accessibility testimonials and business case arguments from different organizations. Advise students that testimonials are often not easy to verify and may require further analysis. Assess students' capacity to identify business case arguments that others are using to implement accessibility.
* Reflective Journal &mdash; Students study article 9 of the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) and share with fellow students their understanding of the core concepts of that article for people with disabilities. Assess students' capacity to relate the benefits they learned about with the main areas covered in the convention from an ICT perspective.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students research if there are accessibility laws and policies applicable to an organization of their choice. Assess students' capacity to identify legal requirements depending on the business sector, size, and nature of such organization.

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to assess the learning outcomes:

* Multiple Choice &mdash; List of business case arguments, each with choices of different benefits; students select the benefits that match the corresponding business case arguments. Assess students' capacity to relate business arguments to accessibility benefits.
* Presentation &mdash; Students present business case arguments that are applicable to an organization of their choice. Assess students' capacity to explain the rationale for each argument.
* Open Book Exam &mdash; Students answer given questions about the scope and applicability of specific policies from [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](https://www.w3.org/wai/policies/). Assess students' capacity to identify how laws and policies impact a particular organization.
