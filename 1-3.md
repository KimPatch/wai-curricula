### Topic: Broader Benefits of Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the broader benefits of accessibility, such as enhancing brand reputation, increasing market reach, and demonstrating social responsibility. Provide examples of organizations that have adopted accessibility and explain the broader benefits that result for these organizations. For foundations on these aspects, refer to [The Business Case for Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* Explain how accessibility can enhance brand reputation and help demonstrate social responsibility.
* Explain how accessibility helps increase use of products.
* Explain how accessibility implementations can help reduce overall maintenance and remediation costs.
* List examples of organizations that have adopted accessibility, and the benefits these organizations report.

#### Teaching Ideas 

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Introduce case studies of organizations who have adopted accessibility. Explain the benefits that resulted from that, such as improved brand reputation from working together more closely with their stakeholders to improve accessibility.
* Give examples of accessible pages and ask students to browse them in different combinations of devices and screen sizes. Contrast them with inaccessible examples. Emphasize how the overall experience is better in accessible pages.
* Reflect about how accessibility can reduce design and development time if implemented from the beginning, e.g., when selecting a specific CMS for a project. Contrast the amount of time it takes to implement accessibility depending on CMS support.

#### Homework Ideas

Optional ideas to assess the learning outcomes:

* Students perform a specific task with the virtual assistant in their mobile phones. For example, students read the news, query the weather, or check items into a shopping cart. 
* Students research how an organization could benefit from improving accessibility implementation. Encourage students to elaborate on specific business opportunities derived from implementing accessibility.

### Topic: Accessibility as a Driver for Innovation

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain how considering all users promotes more inclusive ideas that allow for more innovative products. Provide examples of how some accessibility features are increasingly becoming mainstream, for example in mobile phones and applications. Use examples from [The Business Case for Digital Accessibility (Drive Innovation)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#drive-innovation) and the [The Business Case For Digital Accessibility: Annotated Bibliography](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/bibliography/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* List examples of accessibility features and explain how they also benefit people without disabilities in different situations.
* Explain how accessibility features deliver better user experiences for everyone.
* Explain how accessibility can promote human-centered design approaches, which result in more usable products.

#### Duration

Approximately 30 to 45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Provide analogies between digital accessibility, and social and architectural accessibility. For example, relate digital accessibility to curb cuts in sidewalks that benefit people with strollers, carts, luggage, bicycles, etc.
* Discuss how accessibility features benefit many people in different situations, such as mobile phone users, older people, and people using different hardware. Explain that many features originally designed for accessibility have become mainstream, such as text to speech, voice controls, captions, etc.
* Promote discussion among students about which accessibility features they are familiar with. For example, ask them if they have used voice to dictate or to listen to messages. Elaborate on how these features improve overall student's user experience.

#### Homework Ideas

Optional ideas to assess the learning outcomes:

* Students research and describe different mainstream accessibility features that they are already using, for example on their mobile phone, or accessibility features that they may want to use in the future.
* Students search for publicly-available accessibility testimonials and business case arguments from different organizations. Advise student that testimonials are often not easy to verify and may require further analysis.

### Topic: Minimizing Legal Risk

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain legal requirements relevant to the users, for example national and regional policies. Outline the increasing uptake internationally, including in the [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html). If possible, provide some examples of legal incidences with specific organizations from [The Business Case for Digital Accessibility (Minimize Legal Risk)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#minimize-legal-risk).

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:

* Describe how laws and policies affect the business case for accessibility.
* Describe some potential risks of not addressing accessibility, such as possible lawsuits and costly litigations.
* Identify some international, regional, and local accessibility policies.

#### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Ask students to identify which policies may apply to a particular type of organization. For a list of world wide examples, refer to [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](https://www.w3.org/wai/policies/).
* Refer to specific legal cases related to accessibility and present their settlements or outcomes. Find litigation cases that were both upheld as well as dismissed to determine the reasons for the outcome and explore why the plaintiff brought the case.

#### Homework Ideas

Optional ideas to assess the learning outcomes:

* Students study article 9, right to access to information, of the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) and share with fellow students their understanding of the core concepts of that article for people with disabilities. 
* Students research if there are accessibility laws and policies applicable to an organization of their choice. Students summarize the main implications relevant to the organization.
