## Suggested teaching Outline

The objective of this unit is to present an introduction to the business case of accessibility, to provide information on how accessibility benefits all users of the web, and to enumerate different terms that might play together with  accessibility. It consists of the following lessons:
* Social Dimension of Accessibility: Explains social accessibility as a human right for people with disabilities under the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and highlights some of the international, local, and regional policies that incorporate accessibility.
* Broader benefits of accessibility: Demonstrates how accessibility features also benefit most users of the web such as elderly people, people using mobile devices, people with lower digital skills, etc., in addition to ensuring access for people with disabilities.
* Mainstreaming accessible design: Explains accessibility, usability, and inclusion, and provides mechanisms to address them within the more broader term of user-centered design.

**Note**: This is a suggested teaching outline to help achieve the learning outcomes. Instructors might choose to adapt the sequence of the lessons or their content according to the particular audience and context.

#### Suggested activities 

Engage students in a conversation about how they could improve the right to access to information for people with disabilities in their daily activities.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to write some lines about the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, summarizing the conception that it offers about people with disabilities, and concentrating on their right to access to information found in article 9.

#### Suggested teaching materials

* [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/)

### Lesson 2: Broader benefits of accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate how many of the accessibility features benefit most users of the Web. For example, demonstrate how accessibility benefits older people, people using mobile devices, people with lower digital skills, people who are not fluent in a language, etc. in addition to ensuring access for people with disabilities. Emphasize the innovative aspects of accessibility, such as text-to-speech and speech-recognition.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding that accessibility benefits many  people in addition to people with disabilities.
* Knowledge that accessibility comprises many innovative aspects that imply benefits for the rest of the population.

#### Approximate duration.

20 to 30 minutes.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

**Presentational**: Emphasize on the idea that accessibility solutions are also enjoyed by many people regardless of whether they have a disability or not. Underline the aspects of accessibility that have become mainstream technologies such as text-to-speech or speech recognition.

#### Suggested activities 

Promote discussion among students about which aspects of accessibility benefits them as well as people with disabilities. For instance, ask them if they use any smart assistant built-in to their mobile phone, or if they have a smart speaker at hand.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to write some lines on how a particular aspect that might have been thought for accessibility ends up benefiting most of the users. Ask them to argue in favor of this assertion.

* Understanding the similarities and differences between accessibility, usability, and inclusion.
* Getting acquainted that, even when these three terms often overlap, accessibility is needed to ensure web access for all.
* Knowledge of involving managerial staff and decision makers so that accessibility becomes an intrinsic part of the work in web design and development.

#### Approximate duration.

20 to 30 minutes.

## Ideas for Assessment

* **Knowledge Questions** &mdash; Learners should be able to explain different business case arguments for digital accessibility, and broader benefits of accessibility for people in different situations and contexts.
* **Presentations** &mdash; Learners should be able to develop potential business case arguments for their own organization, and present this to other learners as examples of how they can apply what they have learned.

## Notes

* **Cultural aspects** &mdash; The cultural acceptance and approach to accessibility and disability varies between countries and even individual organizations. The business case arguments may need to be adjusted accordingly.
* **Business context** &mdash; The business context that learners are used to may also require adjustment of the business case arguments. For example, to better relate to their industry sector and organizational culture.
