#### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to assess the learning outcomes.

* Discuss how accessibility features benefit many people in different situations, such as mobile phone users, older people, and people using different hardware. Explain that many features originally designed for accessibility have become mainstream, such as the type-writer, telephone, punch cards, text to speech, email, and voice controls.
* Promote discussion among students about which accessibility features they are familiar with. For example, ask them if they have used voice to dictate or to listen to messages. Elaborate on how these features improve overall student's user experience.
* Provide analogies between digital accessibility, and social and architectural accessibility. For example, relate digital accessibility to the curb cut on sidewalk, which benefits people using strollers, bicycles, pushing carts, carrying luggage, etc. This concept is sometimes referred to as the electronic curb cut.

#### Homework Ideas

The following is a list of homework activities that help students achieve the learning outcomes. Select the ones that best apply to your audience and context or add your own.

* Students search for publicly available accessibility testimonials and business case arguments from different organizations. Advise student that testimonials are often not easy to verify and may require further analysis.
* Students research and describe different mainstream accessibility features that they are already using, for example on their mobile phone, or accessibility features that they may want to use in the future.

#### Teaching Ideas 

The following is a list of homework activities that help students achieve the learning outcomes. Select the ones that best apply to your audience and context or add your own.

* Introduce case studies of organizations who have adopted accessibility. Explain the benefits that resulted from that, such as improved brand reputation from working together more closely with their stakeholders to improve accessibility.
* Give examples of accessible pages and ask students to browse them in different combinations of devices and screen sizes. Contrast them with inaccessible examples. Emphasize how the overall experience is better in accessible pages.
* Reflect with students about how accessibility can reduce development time if implemented from the beginning, e.g., when changing presentational aspects of a page. Contrast the amount of time it takes to make such changes in an accessible and in an inaccessible page.

#### Homework Ideas

The following is a list of homework activities that help students achieve the learning outcomes. Select the ones that best apply to your audience and context or add your own.
