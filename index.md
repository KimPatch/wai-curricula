## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This resource provides a set of role-based curricula for web accessibility. It defines learning outcomes as well as ideas to teach and assess knowledge, to help you design online and in-class courses.

You can use these curricula for formal, informal, guided, non-guided, and vocational training, as well as to assess and compare course offerings.

## Structure

Each curriculum has the following items:

* Modules &mdash; Stand for a specific curriculum. They address one or more audiences and contain a set of units.
  * Units &mdash; Stand for a specific block of content. They define the learning outcomes, a set of topics to teach, ideas to assess knowledge, and a number of teaching resources. You might need to spend different amounts of time for each unit. Adapt the duration of each unit and topic to your particular context.
    * Introduction &mdash; Describes the objectives and sets the foundations for the rest of the contents in the unit. 
    * Learning Outcomes &mdash; Describe what the students need to know after completion of the unit. This is the core of the curricula.
    * Topics &mdash; Stand for specific pieces of content within the units. They also expand the learning outcomes, teaching ideas and ideas to assess knowledge.
    * Teaching Ideas &mdash; Describe a variety of activities that instructors can perform while teaching these units. These are not compulsory. You can adapt them to your particular needs, remove some of them or add new ones if necessary.
    * Ideas to Assess Knowledge &mdash; Describe a variety of activities that instructors can carry out to assess students' performance. These are not compulsory. You can adapt them to your particular needs, remove some of them or add new ones if necessary.
    * Teaching Resources &mdash; Introduce resources to teach the contents in the units. It is advisable that you use them to build the course, but you can extend the list as needed to achieve your particular goals. Some of these are linked through the curricula contents, some others can serve as further readings for you and your students.
