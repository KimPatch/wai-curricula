## Introduction ##

This resource  provides a set of role-based curricula for web accessibility. A curriculum defines the competences and skills for each role, and outlines a set of modules and teaching units to achieve the required knowledge. Each teaching unit describes the goals, learning outcomes; teaching, homework, and assessment ideas; and proposed teaching resources. ***Educators may use this resource*** to develop online and in-class courses. They may follow entire curricula or use only parts, to create custom courses for their particular needs.

## Audience ##

Primary audience of this resource is any educator -- someone who provides formal or informal training. Examples include:

* Trainer, teacher, consultant, expert, and other instructors
* Course owner, designer, maintainer, or otherwise managing courses
* Manager responsible for acquiring courses or establishing training

The delivery of courses based on these curricula can be any combinations of in-class, online, and in-house training.

### Example Scenarios ###

Examples of usage scenarios include the following:

* A web design instructor wants to provide an online course on accessible web design -- the instructor can use the curriculum for web designers and combine it with more specific examples from their own experience as an instructor (eg. emphasize particular tips and tricks).
* University professor teaches a course on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and wants to include accessibility aspects -- the professor refers to related teaching units and selects specific learning objectives and teaching materials to incorporate into the course on HCI.
* A consultant wants to provide an in-house training for a client -- the consultant selects relevant teaching units from different curricula and tailors examples to the particular context of the client (eg. uses examples from the same industry sector as the client etc.).
* An accessibility trainer wants to describe the content of their course for procurers comparing courses -- the trainer refers to related curricula and teaching units to enumerate the topics and learning objectives addressed by their course, in a comparable format.

## Potential Roles to Address ##

Some of the potential audiences that the curricula address could include:

* Non-technical authors (aligns with [ARRM Design Roles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document#Design_Roles) -- Content Creation)
* Managers (aligns with [ARRM Management Roles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document#Management_Roles))
* Designers (aligns with [ARRM Design Roles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document#Design_Roles) -- UI/UX Design)
* Developers (aligns with [ARRM Implementation Roles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document#Implementation_Roles))
* QA Testers (aligns with [ARRM Testing Roles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document#Testing_Roles))
* Procurement
* Management/Leadership:
	* Executives
	* Human Resources
	* Legal/Compliance
* (Advocates/Users/Champions?
* (Business Analysts)
* ...

[**Developing Web Accessibility Presentations and Training**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/teach-advocate/accessibility-training/)
: Serves a similar purpose and contains useful "topics" that could be turned into "teaching units". It may be replaced by these new resources, fully or in-part.

[Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities Mapping](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/RA11y_Matrix)
: Provides useful definition of potential roles and mapping to specific accessibility roles, responsibilities, and criteria

[Stakeholder Roles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Job_Stories_for_Stakeholders)
: Lists many types of audiences and why they may want to use the guidelines

Entire [WAI website](htps://www.w3.org/WAI/)
: Tutorials, Easy Checks, BAD, Perspectives Videos, Getting Started Tips, Business Case, Planning and Managing, etc. are all potential teaching materials.
