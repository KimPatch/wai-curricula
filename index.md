## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This resource provides a set of role-based curricula for web accessibility. It defines learning outcomes as well as ideas to teach and assess knowledge, to help you design online and in-class courses.

You can use these curricula for formal, informal, guided, non-guided, and vocational training, as well as to assess and compare course offerings.

## Structure

Each curriculum has the following items:

* Modules &mdash; Autonomous portions of content. You can teach them independently. They include:
* Introduction &mdash; Sets the foundations for the rest of the contents in the module. 
* Learning Outcomes &mdash; Describe what the students will know and should be able to demonstrate after completion of the module. This is the core of the curricula.
* Competencies &mdash; Skills that you and your students should have prior to the module.
* Topics &mdash; Thematic pieces of content. They provide detailed learning outcomes, teaching ideas, and ideas to assess knowledge.
* Teaching Ideas &mdash; Optional activities that you can include in your teaching.
* Ideas to Assess Knowledge &mdash; Optional activities that you can carry out to assess students' knowledge of the learning outcomes.
* Teaching Resources &mdash; Recommended resources that help you deliver the learning outcomes. Some are integrated as part of the teaching and others are further readings for you and your students.

## Outline

Rows of the following table refer to three levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced. Columns refer to five roles: developer, designer, author, manager, and tester. Curricula for the basic level is already developed. Intermediate and advanced levels are still under analysis. We will update the table as we develop new content.
