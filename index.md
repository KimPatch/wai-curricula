## Introduction

This resource provides a set of role-based curricula for web accessibility. It defines the competences and skills for each role, and outlines a set of modules and teaching units to achieve the required knowledge.

Each teaching unit describes the goals, learning outcomes; teaching, homework, and assessment ideas; and proposed teaching resources.

The delivery of courses based on these curricula can be any combinations of in-class, online, and in-house training. You may follow entire curricula or use only parts, to create custom courses for your particular needs.
