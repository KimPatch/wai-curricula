## Introduction

Introduce real stories of how people with disabilities use the web by referring to the [[How people with Disabilities use the Web]](#people-use-web) resource, and explain some accessibility features and barriers. If you can, bring real people with disabilities since face-to-face encounters can increase engagement among learners and favor thought-exchanges.
Provide an introduction on the topic web accessibility and explain its definition and scope by referring to the [[Introduction to Web Accessibility]](#accessibility-intro) resource.  Explain key terminology used in this context and inter-relations with other technological disciplines based on the [[Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion]](#accessibility-usability-inclusion) resource.

## Suggested teaching Outline

This is a suggested teaching outline to help achieve the learning outcomes. You might choose to adapt the sequence of the topics or their content according to the particular audience and context.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Stories of people with disabilities

Provide tangible examples of people with disabilities using the Web. If possible, invite real users to demonstrate how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to interact with the Web. Relate these experiences with some accessibility features and barriers, as well as some adaptive strategies and assistive technologies.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning outcomes

* Gaining empathy, inspiration, and motivation for the topic.
* Understanding how some individuals with disabilities use the Web.
* Appreciating the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.

#### Approximate duration.

1-2 hours, depending on demonstrations and activities.

{% endcomment %}

#### Suggested teaching activities 

* Invite people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies — this is often the first encounter for students to observe real use of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.
* If it is not possible to bring in real people with disabilities, consider using video recordings or images and story-telling techniques to help illustrate realistic personas and user stories.
* Invite people with disabilities for a discussion on their daily experience while using the Web — This is often the first opportunity for students to engage with people with disabilities and to build more empathy.
* Ask students to try and follow along an experienced user using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. For example, using text to speech, speech recognition, and other accessibility features built into their mobile phones.

* Ask students to try out using assistive technologies as demonstrated by experienced users — this can be a fun way to get an understanding and appreciations for different ways of interacting with the Web.

**Tip:** Commonly it is helpful to show examples of people using accessible content first, so that students realize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design. As you may only have time for one or two examples, make sure to emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even with the same type of disability. Also emphasize how design features can enable or disable people. That is, emphasize the social model of disability and avoid using a medical approach. Avoid frequently encountered clichés and myths. Complement the few examples that you cover in-depth with some examples of people with other types of disabilities.

**Note:** Later contents will introduce different types of disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies in more depth. This topic is primarily intended for firsthand experience of real people, which is often first encounter for students.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to reflect on their observations, for example in a short essay (200-300 words). Students should explain some of the design features that one of the assistive technologies they learned about relies on to function.

### Topic: Scope of Web Accessibility

Introduce the definition and scope of web accessibility, present some common terminology used and explain the inter-relations between accessibility and some other UX disciplines.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding the definition of accessibility in the context of the web.
* Understanding the relevance of web accessibility in a growing number of devices and contexts.
* Knowledge on the distinctions and overlaps between accessibility, usability and inclusion.
* Understanding the social dimension of accessibility to include people with disabilities.

#### Approximate duration.

15 minutes.

#### Suggested teaching activities 

* Define web accessibility as the ability for people with disabilities to use web content, tools, and technology equally.
* Explain the relevance of web accessibility, given the widespread use of web content and applications across different types of devices (desktop, mobile, television, etc.) for social participation (for education, employment, commerce, healthcare, entertainment, etc).
* Refer to accessibility as a social right for people with dissabilities under the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]](#convention-rights-people-disabilities) (UN CRPD).

**tip**: This topic sets the tone for future topics on the components of web accessibility, its business case, the applicable standards, and some planning and managing strategies. To prepare students for this further knowledge, emphasize that accessibility primarily focuses on the usability for people with disabilities and describe how accessibility characteristics benefits all users, e.e., mobile device users or users not fluent in the language.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to write a short essay in which they reflect on accessibility features present in buildings, transportation, education, helthcare or any other aspect of their daily life. Encourage them to draw analogies with web accessibility and to think about some characteristics that digital products may have to ensure they are accessible for all.

## Ideas for Assessment

* **Attitudinal** Students should be aware that everybody, regardless of their disability, is able to use web and technology equally. they should understand that barriers are not caused by disabilities but by decissions taken at any stage of the projects that affect accessibility.
* **Knowledge Questions** &mdash; Learners should be able to recite the definition of web accessibility, explain different terms, and understand how web accessibility plays a definitive role in other technologies different than web pages and applications.

## Suggested Teaching Materials

It lists different types of settings and assistive tools that are available on different systems.
* <a id="accessibility-intro" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a> &mdash; provides an overview on web accessibility, including a 4 minute video with examples of accessibility features and barriers.

* <a id="accessibility-usability-inclusion" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/">Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion</a> &mdash; Explains the distinctions and overlaps between the terms accessibility, usability, and inclusion, and how these are best addressed together using a user-centered design process.

## Notes

* **Initial awareness** &mdash; The initial level of awareness for accessibility and disability will often vary for each learner. Asking learners to share examples from their own experiences can encourage thought-exchange.
* **Laying foundations** &mdash; Much of the content in this teaching unit is intended to lay foundations for further exploration and discussion in later teaching units. The corresponding courses need to be well-aligned.
