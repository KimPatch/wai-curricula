## Suggested teaching Outline

The objective of this unit is to provide students with the definition and scope of Web Accessibility, to present some accessibility barriers and features, and to explain how accessibility relates with some other web technologies and components such as HTML, authoring tools, browsers or assistive tools. It consists of the following lessons:
* Stories of people with disabilities: demonstrates real examples of people with disabilities using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to interact with the Web, and provides examples of some web accessibility features and barriers and how they impact several user profiles.
* Scope of web accesibility: introduces the concept and scope of web accessibility, and explains the inter-relation between accessibility features in web technologies such as HTML, in web content, web authoring tools, web browsers, and assistive tools.

**Note**: This is a suggested teaching outline to help achieve the learning outcomes. Instructors might choose to adapt the sequence of the lessons or their content according to the particular audience and context.

### Topic: Stories of people with disabilities

Provide tangible examples of people with disabilities using the Web. If possible, invite real users to demonstrate how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to interact with the Web. If it is not possible to bring in real people with disabilities, consider using video recordings. If video cannot be used either, use images and story-telling techniques to help illustrate realistic personas and user stories, such as those provided in the teaching materials.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

As you may only have time for one or two examples, make sure to emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even with the same type of disability. Also emphasize how design features can enable or disable people. That is, emphasize the social model of disability and avoid using a medical approach. Avoid frequently encountered clich√©s and myths. Complement the few examples that you cover in-depth with some examples of people with other types of disabilities.

**Tip:** Commonly it is helpful to show examples of people using accessible content first, so that students realize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.

**Note:** Later contents will introduce different types of disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies in more depth. This lesson is primarily intended for firsthand experience of real people, which is often first encounter for students.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding how some individuals with disabilities use the Web.
* Appreciating the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.
* Gaining empathy, inspiration, and motivation for the topic.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

* **Demonstrations**: Invite people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies - this is often the first encounter for students to observe real use of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.
* **Conversational**: Invite people with disabilities for a discussion on their daily experience while using the Web - this is often the first opportunity for students to engage with people with disabilities and to build more empathy.
* **Experiential**: Ask students to try out using assistive technologies as demonstrated by experienced users - this can be a fun way to get an understanding and appreciations for different ways of interacting with the Web.

### Lesson 1:  Meaning of web accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

* Define web accessibility as ability for people with disabilities to use web content, tools, and technology equally.
* Explain the relevance of web accessibility, given the widespread use of web content and applications across different types of devices (desktop, mobile, television, etc.) for social participation (for education, employment, commerce, healthcare, entertainment, etc.).
* Explain the inter-relation between accessibility features in web technologies such as HTML, in web content, web authoring tools, web browsers, and assistive tools.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding the definition of web accessibility as the ability for people with disabilities to use web content, tools, and technology equally.
* Understanding that web accessibility is present in a growing number of devices and contexts.
* Understanding the inter-relation between web accessibility, web technologies such as HTML, and web components such as browsers or assistive tools.
* Knowledge of some accessibility features and barriers that are related to these web technologies and components.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

* **presentational**:
	* Provide students with the definition of accessibility and relate it with other ICT disciplines.
	* Emphasize the importance of this field to allow people with disabilities to access web interfaces and applications.
	* Explain that web accessibility is achieved by a variety of technologies and components working together: refer to web technologies such as HTML and components such as web browsers, authoring tools or assistive tools.
	* Elaborate on how issues and repairs might depend on one particular component (eg, if a user has an older browser, it might not support newer accessibility technologies

## Ideas for Assessment

* **Knowledge Questions** &mdash; Learners should be able to recite the definition of web accessibility, explain different terms, and enumerate different components of web accessibility and how they inter-relate.

## Suggested Teaching Materials

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a> &mdash; provides an overview on web accessibility, including a 4 minute video with examples of accessibility features and barriers.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/">Essential Components of Web Accessibility</a> &mdash; explains key terms, and the inter-relation between different components of web accessibility (eg. web technologies, authoring tools, browsers, etc.).
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> &mdash; provides stories of people with diverse disabilities using the Web; enumerates different types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/">Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)</a> &mdash; series of 10 videos, each of around 1 minute duration, that highlight different types of accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities and other users. For example, one video introduces colors with good contrast and how it benefits many people.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/">Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion</a> &mdash; Explains the distinctions and overlaps between the terms accessibility, usability, and inclusion, and how these are best addressed together using a user-centered design process.
* <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)</a> &mdash; Lists the countries that signed and ratified the convention and optional protocol, and provides news and information on implementation of the convention.

## Notes

* **Initial awareness** &mdash; The initial level of awareness for accessibility and disability will often vary for each learner. Asking learners to share examples from their own experiences can encourage thought-exchange.
* **Laying foundations** &mdash; Much of the content in this teaching unit is intended to lay foundations for further exploration and discussion in later teaching units. The corresponding courses need to be well-aligned.
