## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this unit are expected to:
* raise awareness of how people with disabilities use websites and applications
* introduce core concepts of digital accessibility
* explain related terms such as usability, user experience, and inclusive design

## Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:
* Describe examples of how people with disabilities use the Web
* Define web accessibility for people with disabilities
* Describe how “the Web” is used on devices such as mobile phones, smart TVs, watches, and home appliances

## Competencies

The following is a list of skills required for this unit.

Students

: Basic &mdash; Basic understanding of computers and the Web.

Instructors

## Topics to Teach

The following topics help achieve the learning outcomes. Adapt the sequence of topics, the activities you do, and the homework you assign for your particular students and context.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Stories of People with Disabilities

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce real stories of how people with disabilities interact with web pages and applications. If you can, invite people with disabilities to demonstrate assistive technologies and adaptive strategies they use. Include time for students to ask questions. If you cannot bring real people, then use resources such as [Web Accessibility Perspectives Videos](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/) and [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:
* Describe how some people with disabilities use the Web
* List some design features that benefit people with disabilities
* List some design barriers that exclude people with disabilities
* Recognize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design

{% comment %}

#### Duration.

Approximately 1-2 hours depending on demonstrations and activities.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Point out how design features can enable or disable people by teaching the social model of disability. Refer to Introduction to Web Accessibility page, [Accessibility in Context section](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#context].
* Invite expert users with disabilities to show the assistive technologies and adaptive strategies they use when interacting with websites and applications. Ask these users to explain some accessibility features and barriers.
* Coach students in trying out assistive technologies and adaptive strategies by themselves. For example, invite them to follow advanced users and experiment with text to speech, speech recognition, and other accessibility features built into their mobile phones. Ask students to reflect on their experiences.
* Relate accessibility features and barriers to the performance of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. For an introduction to certain assistive tools and adaptive strategies, refer to the resource [Tools and Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/).

**Important:**
* Emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even when those users have the same type of disability.
* For information on avoiding clichés and myths, see [Interacting with People with Disabilities {% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/interact.html).

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to reflect on their observations, for example, in a short essay. Students should explain some of the design features that one of the assistive technologies they learned about relies on to function.
* Ask students to research more about a particular type of disability or an assistive technology they are interested in. Encourage them to elaborate on the innovation, potential, and broader benefits of accessibility features.
* Introduce popular people with disabilities, such as Frida Kahlo, Stephen Hawking, or Stevie Wonder. Ask students to research about how technology helped them or others achieve their successes.

### Topic: Scope of Web Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the definition and scope of web accessibility. Present common terminology using the resource [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/).

Explain the overlaps between accessibility and usability. Emphasize how accessibility fits into design practices such as inclusive design. Use the resource [Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:
* Define web accessibility for people with disabilities
* Identify the relevance of web accessibility in a growing number of devices and contexts
* Explain key terms in web accessibility
* Compare accessibility, usability, and inclusion, and describe some of the overlaps between them
* Identify the social dimension of accessibility to include people with disabilities

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Define web accessibility as the ability for people with disabilities to use web content, tools, and technology equally.
* Guide students through a reflection on the relevance of web accessibility. Focus on the widespread use of web content and applications across different types of devices (desktop, mobile, television, etc.). Emphasize that accessibility favors social participation (for education, employment, commerce, healthcare, entertainment, etc.). Encourage students to participate in the discussion by adding any previous experiences of access barriers and exposure to accessibility.
* Engage students in a conversation about the relationship between accessibility for people with disabilities and other people: older people, people not fluent in a language, people new to technology or with lower digital skills, and others.
* Explain that accessibility is part of overall inclusion, since accessibility features benefit all users as well as those with disabilities.
* Define usability as the discipline in charge of designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying. Describe some overlaps in usability
and accessibility. Explain that accessibility is needed to cover those aspects from the perspective of people with disabilities.
* Introduce examples of accessibility in urban environments, buildings, transportation, etc. Explain how these relate to the digital context. Use ramps and high-contrast features to illustrate how accessibility characteristics are also beneficial for all users.
* Refer to accessibility as a social right for people with disabilities under the United Nations [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html).

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to collect information on accessibility features in buildings, transportation, education, healthcare or any other aspect of their daily life. Encourage them to draw analogies with web accessibility and to think about some characteristics that digital products have to make them accessible.
* Ask students to select a technology device (e.g., computer, smartphone, smartwatch, television, etc.) and learn about the accessibility features and settings that are available on the device. Select a type of disability and determine which features and settings on that device would help remove barriers for people with that disability type. Have students describe which features and settings they would benefit from using even if they do not have a disability, and why.

## Ideas for Assessment

Students should be able to:

* communicate that everybody, regardless of their disability, can use technology equally when it is accessible. They should explain that barriers are not caused by disabilities, but by decisions made during the project development.
* define web accessibility and related terms such as usability and inclusion.
* explain that web accessibility plays a fundamental role in other technologies beyond web pages and applications.
* describe some of the most important barriers preventing people with disabilities from using technology.
