## Suggested teaching Outline

This is a suggested teaching outline to help achieve the learning outcomes. Instructors might choose to adapt the sequence of the lessons or their content according to the particular audience and context.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Stories of people with disabilities

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding how some individuals with disabilities use the Web.
* Appreciating the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.
* Gaining empathy, inspiration, and motivation for the topic.

#### Approximate duration.

1-2 hours, depending on demonstrations and activities.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

* **Demonstrations**: Invite people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies - this is often the first encounter for students to observe real use of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.
* **Conversational**: Invite people with disabilities for a discussion on their daily experience while using the Web - this is often the first opportunity for students to engage with people with disabilities and to build more empathy.
* **Experiential**: Ask students to try out using assistive technologies as demonstrated by experienced users - this can be a fun way to get an understanding and appreciations for different ways of interacting with the Web.

Provide tangible examples of people with disabilities using the Web. If possible, invite real users to demonstrate how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to interact with the Web. If it is not possible to bring in real people with disabilities, consider using video recordings. If video cannot be used either, use images and story-telling techniques to help illustrate realistic personas and user stories, such as those provided in the teaching materials.

As you may only have time for one or two examples, make sure to emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even with the same type of disability. Also emphasize how design features can enable or disable people. That is, emphasize the social model of disability and avoid using a medical approach. Avoid frequently encountered clich√©s and myths. Complement the few examples that you cover in-depth with some examples of people with other types of disabilities.

**Tip:** Commonly it is helpful to show examples of people using accessible content first, so that students realize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.

**Note:** Later contents will introduce different types of disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies in more depth. This lesson is primarily intended for firsthand experience of real people, which is often first encounter for students.

#### Suggested activities 

Ask students to try and follow along an experienced user using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. For example, using text to speech, speech recognition, and other accessibility features built into their mobile phones.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to reflect on their observations, for example in a short essay (200-300 words). Students should explain some of the design features that one of the assistive technologies they learned about relies on to function.

### Topic: Scope of web accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding the definition of web accessibility as the ability for people with disabilities to use web content, tools, and technology equally.
* Understanding that web accessibility is present in a growing number of devices and contexts.
* Understanding the inter-relation between web accessibility, web technologies such as HTML, and web components such as browsers or assistive tools.
* Awareness of some accessibility features and barriers that are related to these web technologies and components.

#### Approximate duration.

15 minutes.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

* **presentational**:
	* Define web accessibility as ability for people with disabilities to use web content, tools, and technology equally.
	* Explain the relevance of web accessibility, given the widespread use of web content and applications across different types of devices (desktop, mobile, television, etc.) for social participation (for education, employment, commerce, healthcare, entertainment, etc.).
	* Explain the inter-relation between accessibility features in web technologies such as HTML, in web content, web authoring tools, web browsers, and assistive tools.

#### Suggested activities 

Promote discussion among students on how web accessibility is built by several web technologies and components working together. Encourage them to give examples of these inter-relations in the context of their daily tasks and overall experience.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to write a couple of paragraphs in which they enumerate the different components of web accessibility that have been introduced. Ask them to point to some barriers and features that might depend on each of the listed components.

## Ideas for Assessment

* **Knowledge Questions** &mdash; Learners should be able to recite the definition of web accessibility, explain different terms, and enumerate different components of web accessibility and how they inter-relate.

## Suggested Teaching Materials

* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a> &mdash; provides an overview on web accessibility, including a 4 minute video with examples of accessibility features and barriers.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/">Essential Components of Web Accessibility</a> &mdash; explains key terms, and the inter-relation between different components of web accessibility (eg. web technologies, authoring tools, browsers, etc.).
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> &mdash; provides stories of people with diverse disabilities using the Web; enumerates different types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/">Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)</a> &mdash; series of 10 videos, each of around 1 minute duration, that highlight different types of accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities and other users. For example, one video introduces colors with good contrast and how it benefits many people.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/">Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion</a> &mdash; Explains the distinctions and overlaps between the terms accessibility, usability, and inclusion, and how these are best addressed together using a user-centered design process.
* <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)</a> &mdash; Lists the countries that signed and ratified the convention and optional protocol, and provides news and information on implementation of the convention.

## Notes

* **Initial awareness** &mdash; The initial level of awareness for accessibility and disability will often vary for each learner. Asking learners to share examples from their own experiences can encourage thought-exchange.
* **Laying foundations** &mdash; Much of the content in this teaching unit is intended to lay foundations for further exploration and discussion in later teaching units. The corresponding courses need to be well-aligned.
