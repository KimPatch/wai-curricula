## Topics to Teach

The following topics help achieve the learning outcomes. You might choose to adapt the sequence of these topics, the activities you carry out, and the homework you provide according to the particular audience and context.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Stories of People with Disabilities

Introduce real stories of how people with disabilities use the Web. If you can, invite real people with disabilities to demonstrate how they use the Web. This face-to-face encounter increases engagement among learners and encourages thought-exchange. If you cannot bring real people, then use resources such as [Web Accessibility Perspectives](#perspectives-videos) videos and the [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](#people-use-web), which provide realistic examples.

#### Learning Outcomes

* Gaining empathy, inspiration, and motivation for the topic
* Understanding how some individuals with disabilities use the Web
* Appreciating the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design

{% comment %}

#### Duration.

Approximately 1-2 hours depending on demonstrations and activities.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Invite people with disabilities to demonstrate the assistive technologies or other adaptive strategies that they use interacting with the Web. Ask them to explain their experiences while using the Web, such as frequently encountered barriers and strategies they use to work around them.
* Coach students in trying out assistive technologies and adaptive strategies by themselves. For example, invite them to experiment with text to speech, speech recognition, and other accessibility features built into their mobile phones. Ask students to reflect on their experiences.
* Relate the experiences of how real people with disabilities use the Web to accessibility features and barriers in the design and to the functionality of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. The resource [How people with Disabilities use the Web](#people-use-web) explains such relationships.

{% comment %}

* Invite people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies — This is often the first encounter for students to observe real use of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.
* If it is not possible to bring in real people with disabilities, consider using video recordings or images and story-telling techniques to help illustrate realistic personas and user stories.
* Ask students to try out using assistive technologies as demonstrated by experienced users — This can be a fun way to get an understanding and appreciations for different ways of interacting with the Web.

{% endcomment %}

**Tip:** Show examples of people using accessible content first, so that students realize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design. As you may be only inviting one or two people, make sure to emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even with the same type of disability. Also emphasize how design features can enable or disable people. That is, emphasize the social model of disability and avoid using a medical approach. Avoid frequently encountered clichés and myths. Complement the few examples that you cover in-depth with some examples of people with other types of disabilities.

{% comment %}

**Note:** Later contents will introduce different types of disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies in more depth. This topic is primarily intended for firsthand experience of real people, which is often first encounter for students.

{% endcomment %}

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to reflect on their observations, for example in a short essay (200-300 words). Students should explain some of the design features that one of the assistive technologies they learned about relies on to function.
* Ask students to research more about particular types of disability or assistive technology they are interested in. Encourage them to elaborate on the innovation potential and broader benefits of accessibility features.
* Ask students to research about popular people with disabilities, such as Frida Kahlo, Stephen Hawking, or Stevie Wonder, and how technology helped them achieve their successes.

### Topic: Scope of Web Accessibility

Introduce the definition and scope of web accessibility. Present common terminology using the [Introduction to Web Accessibility] resource.  
Explain the overlaps between accessibility and usability, and emphasize how accessibility fits into design practices such as inclusive design, using the [Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion](#accessibility-usability-inclusion) resource.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning Outcomes

* Understanding the definition of accessibility in the context of the Web
* Understanding the relevance of web accessibility in a growing number of devices and contexts
* Knowledge of the distinctions and overlaps between accessibility, usability and inclusion
* Understanding the social dimension of accessibility to include people with disabilities
* Appreciation for overlapping user needs and the principles of inclusive design

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Define web accessibility as the ability for people with disabilities to use web content, tools, and technology equally.
* Guide students through a reflection  on the relevance of web accessibility, given the widespread use of web content and applications across different types of devices (desktop, mobile, television, etc.) for social participation (for education, employment, commerce, healthcare, entertainment, etc.). Encourage them to participate, especially if they have had any previous exposure to accessibility.
* Engage  students in a conversation about the relationship between accessibility for people with disabilities and other people they know, such as older people, people not fluent in a language, people new to technology or with lower digital skills, and others. Explain that accessibility is part of overall inclusion.
* Introduce examples of accessibility in urban environments, buildings, transportation, etc., and explain how these relate to the digital context. Use ramps and high-contrast features to illustrate how accessibility characteristics are also beneficial for all users.
* Refer to accessibility as a social right for people with disabilities under the United Nations [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](#convention-rights-people-disabilities) (UN CRPD).

**Tip**: This topic sets the tone for future topics on the components of web accessibility, its business case, the applicable standards, and some planning and managing strategies. To prepare students for this further knowledge, emphasize that accessibility focuses primarily on the usability for people with disabilities and describe how accessibility characteristics benefit all users, e.g., mobile device users or users not fluent in the language.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to collect information on accessibility features present in buildings, transportation, education, healthcare or any other aspect of their daily life. Encourage them to draw analogies with web accessibility and to think about some characteristics that digital products may have to ensure they are accessible for all.

## Ideas for Assessment

* Students should be aware that everybody, regardless of their disability, is able to use web and technology equally. they should understand that barriers are not caused by disabilities but by decisions taken at any stage of the project that affect accessibility.
* Learners should be able to recite the definition of web accessibility, explain different terms, and understand how web accessibility plays a definitive role in other technologies different than web pages and applications.

## Suggested Teaching Resources

* <a id="people-use-web" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> &mdash; provides stories of people with diverse disabilities using the Web; enumerates different types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* <a id="perspectives-videos" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/">Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)</a> &mdash; series of 10 videos, each of around 1 minute duration, that highlight different types of accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities and other users. For example, one video introduces colors with good contrast and how it benefits many people.
* <a id="accessibility-intro" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a> &mdash; provides an overview on web accessibility, including a 4 minute video with examples of accessibility features and barriers.
* <a id="convention-rights-people-disabilities" href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)</a> &mdash; Lists the countries that signed and ratified the convention and optional protocol, and provides news and information on implementation of the convention.
* <a id="accessibility-usability-inclusion" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/">Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion</a> &mdash; Explains the distinctions and overlaps between the terms accessibility, usability, and inclusion, and how these are best addressed together using a user-centered design process.

## Notes

* **Initial awareness** &mdash; The initial level of awareness for accessibility and disability will often vary for each learner. Asking learners to share examples from their own experiences can encourage thought-exchange.
* **Laying foundations** &mdash; Much of the content in this teaching unit is intended to lay foundations for further exploration and discussion in later teaching units. The corresponding courses need to be well-aligned.
