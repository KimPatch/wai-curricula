## Suggested teaching Outline

This is a suggested teaching outline to help achieve the learning outcomes. Instructors might choose to adapt the sequence of the lessons or their content according to the particular audience and context.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Stories of people with disabilities

Introduces real examples of how people with disabilities use the web, together with some accessibility features and barriers, as well as some adaptive strategies and assistive technologies.

* Understanding how some individuals with disabilities use the Web.
* Appreciating the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.
* Gaining empathy, inspiration, and motivation for the topic.

#### Suggested teaching activities 

{% comment %}

* Provide tangible examples of people with disabilities using the Web. If possible, invite real users to demonstrate how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to interact with the Web. 

{% endcomment %}

* Invite people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies [[How people with disabilities use the Web]](#people-use-web) — this is often the first encounter for students to observe real use of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.
* If it is not possible to bring in real people with disabilities, consider using video recordings or images and story-telling techniques to help illustrate realistic personas and user stories [[Web Accessibility Perspective-videos]](#perspectives).
* Invite people with disabilities for a discussion on their daily experience while using the Web [[Better Web Browsing]](#better-web-browsing) — This is often the first opportunity for students to engage with people with disabilities and to build more empathy.
* Ask students to try out using assistive technologies as demonstrated by experienced users — this can be a fun way to get an understanding and appreciations for different ways of interacting with the Web.
* Ask students to try and follow along an experienced user using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. For example, using text to speech, speech recognition, and other accessibility features built into their mobile phones.

**Tip**: Commonly it is helpful to show examples of people using accessible content first, so that students realize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design. As you may only have time for one or two examples, make sure to emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even with the same type of disability. Also emphasize how design features can enable or disable people. That is, emphasize the social model of disability and avoid using a medical approach. Avoid frequently encountered clichés and myths. Complement the few examples that you cover in-depth with some examples of people with other types of disabilities.

**Note:** Later contents will introduce different types of disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies in more depth. This topic is primarily intended for firsthand experience of real people, which is often first encounter for students.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to reflect on their observations, for example in a short essay (200-300 words). Students should explain some of the design features that one of the assistive technologies they learned about relies on to function.

### Topic: Scope of web accessibility

Introduces the definition of web accessibility, presents some common terminology used and explains the inter-relations between accessibility and some other web disciplines.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding the definition of web accessibility as the ability for people with disabilities to use web content, tools, and technology equally.
* Understanding the presence of web accessibility in a growing number of devices and contexts in addition to web ppages and applications.
* Knowledge on the distinctions and overlaps between accessibility, usability and inclusion.
* Understanding the role of accessibility from a social dimension's perspective as a mean to include people with disabilities.

#### Approximate duration.

15 minutes.

#### Suggested teaching activities 

* Define web accessibility as ability for people with disabilities to use web content, tools, and technology equally [[Introduction to web accessibility]](#accessibility-intro).
* Explain the relevance of web accessibility, given the widespread use of web content and applications across different types of devices (desktop, mobile, television, etc.) for social participation (for education, employment, commerce, healthcare, entertainment, etc) [[Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion]](#accessibility-usability-inclusion).

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to write a short essay in which they reflect on accessibility features present in buildings, transport, or any other aspect of their daily life. Encourage them to draw analogies with web accessibility and to elaborate on some characteristics that digital products may have to ensure accessibility is lresent.

## Ideas for Assessment

* **Knowledge Questions** &mdash; Learners should be able to recite the definition of web accessibility, explain different terms, and understand how web accessibility plays a definitive role in other technologies different than web pages and applications.

## Suggested Teaching Materials

* <a id="people-use-web" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> &mdash; provides stories of people with diverse disabilities using the Web; enumerates different types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* <a id="perspective-videos" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/">Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)</a> &mdash; series of 10 videos, each of around 1 minute duration, that highlight different types of accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities and other users. For example, one video introduces colors with good contrast and how it benefits many people.
* <a id="better-web-browsing" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing">(Work in progress) Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer</a> &mdash; provides references to resources to help users customize their particular web browser and computer setup, to improve their accessibility experience. It lists different types of settings and assistive tools that are available on different systems.
* <a id="accessibility-intro" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a> &mdash; provides an overview on web accessibility, including a 4 minute video with examples of accessibility features and barriers.
* <a id="accessibility-usability-inclusion" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/">Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion</a> &mdash; Explains the distinctions and overlaps between the terms accessibility, usability, and inclusion, and how these are best addressed together using a user-centered design process.

## Notes

* **Initial awareness** &mdash; The initial level of awareness for accessibility and disability will often vary for each learner. Asking learners to share examples from their own experiences can encourage thought-exchange.
* **Laying foundations** &mdash; Much of the content in this teaching unit is intended to lay foundations for further exploration and discussion in later teaching units. The corresponding courses need to be well-aligned.
