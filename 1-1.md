## Topics to Teach

The following topics help achieve the learning outcomes. Adapt the sequence of topics, the activities you do, and the homework you assign for your particular students and context.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Stories of People with Disabilities

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce real stories of how people with disabilities interact with web pages and applications. If you can, invite people with disabilities to demonstrate assistive technologies and adaptive strategies they use. Include time for students to ask questions. If you cannot bring real people, then use resources such as [Web Accessibility Perspectives Videos](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/) and [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* Describe how some people with disabilities use the Web.
* List some design features that benefit people with disabilities.
* List some design barriers that exclude people with disabilities.
* Recognize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.

#### Duration.

Approximately 1-2 hours depending on demonstrations and activities.

#### Teaching Ideas

The following is a list of activities to teach the learning outcomes. You can use one or several from the below or add the one specific to your audience and context.

* Point out how design features can enable or disable people by teaching the social model of disability. Refer to Introduction to Web Accessibility page, [Accessibility in Context section](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#context).
* Invite expert users with disabilities to show the assistive technologies and adaptive strategies they use when interacting with websites and applications. Ask these users to explain some accessibility features and barriers.
* Coach students in trying out assistive technologies and adaptive strategies by themselves. For example, invite them to follow advanced users and experiment with text to speech, speech recognition, and other accessibility features built into their mobile phones. Ask students to reflect on their experiences.
* Explain how different accessibility features and barriers impact use of the content with assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. For an introduction to certain assistive tools and adaptive strategies, refer to the resource [Tools and Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/).

**Important:**
* Emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even when those users have the same type of disability.
* For information on avoiding clichés and myths, see [Interacting with People with Disabilities {% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/interact.html).

#### Homework Ideas

The following is a list of homework activities that help students achieve the learning outcomes. Select the ones that best apply to your audience and context or add your own.

* Students write a short report describing some of the design features that one of the assistive technologies they learned about relies on to function. 
* Students research more about a particular type of disability or an assistive technology they are interested in. Students reflect on the innovation, potential, and broader benefits of accessibility features.
* Students research about how technology helped popular people with disabilities in their daily lives. Examples: Frida Kahlo, Stephen Hawking, or Stevie Wonder.

### Topic: Scope of Web Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the definition and scope of web accessibility. Present common terminology using the resource [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/).

Explain the overlaps between accessibility and usability. Emphasize how accessibility fits into design practices such as inclusive design. Use the resource [Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* Define web accessibility for people with disabilities.
* Identify the relevance of web accessibility in a growing number of devices and contexts.
* Explain key terms in web accessibility.
* Outline the scope of accessibility, usability, and inclusion, and describe some of the overlaps between them.
* Identify the social dimension of accessibility.

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

#### Teaching Ideas

The following is a list of activities to teach the learning outcomes. You can use one or several from the below or add the one specific to your audience and context.

* Define web accessibility as the ability for people with disabilities to use web content, tools, and technology equally.
* Guide students through a reflection on the relevance of web accessibility. Focus on the widespread use of web content and applications across different types of devices (desktop, mobile, television, etc.). Emphasize that accessibility favors social participation (for education, employment, commerce, healthcare, entertainment, etc.). Encourage students to participate in the discussion by adding any previous experiences of access barriers and exposure to accessibility.
* Engage students in a conversation about the relationship between accessibility for people with disabilities and other people: older people, people not fluent in a language, people new to technology or with lower digital skills, and others.
* Explain that accessibility is part of overall inclusion, since accessibility features benefit all users as well as those with disabilities.
* Define usability as the discipline of designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying. Describe some overlaps in usability
and accessibility. Explain that accessibility is needed to cover those aspects from the perspective of people with disabilities.
* Introduce examples of accessibility in urban environments, buildings, transportation, etc. Explain how these relate to the digital context. Use ramps and high-contrast features to illustrate how accessibility characteristics are also beneficial for all users.
* Refer to accessibility as a social right for people with disabilities under the United Nations [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html).

#### Homework Ideas

The following is a list of homework activities that help students achieve the learning outcomes. Select the ones that best apply to your audience and context or add your own.

* Students research accessibility features in buildings, transportation, education, healthcare or any other aspect of their daily life, and draw analogies with web accessibility. Students focus on features that help make digital products accessible, such as text alternatives or good contrast ratios.
* Students select a technology device (e.g., computer, smartphone, smartwatch, television, etc.) and learn about the accessibility features and settings that are available on the device. Select a type of disability and determine which features and settings on that device would help remove barriers for people with that disability type. Have students describe which features and settings they would benefit from using even if they do not have a disability, and why.

## Ideas for Assessment

The following is a list of activities to assess if students have achieved the learning outcomes. You can use them or add your own if necessary.

* Presentation &mdash; Students reflect on how everybody, regardless of their disability, can use technology equally when it is accessible. Students focus on how decisions made during the project development can create accessibility features or barriers.
* Short answer questions &mdash; Students provide the definition for terms such as web accessibility, usability, and inclusion.
* Presentation &mdas; Students explain that web accessibility plays a fundamental role in other technologies beyond web pages and applications. For instance, students focus on a smart assistant and elaborate on how web accessibility features allow people with disabilities to use it.
* Report &mdash; Students describe some of the most important barriers preventing people with disabilities from using technology.
