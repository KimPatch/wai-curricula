## Suggested teaching Outline

The objective of this unit is to provide students with the definition and scope of Web Accessibility, to present some accessibility barriers and features, and to explain how accessibility relates with some other web technologies and components such as HTML, authoring tools, browsers or assistive tools. It consists of the following lessons:
* Meaning of web accessibility: introduces the concept and scope of web accessibility and explains it as an opportunity for inclusion of people with disabilities.
* Examples of web accessibility: provides examples of some web accessibility features and barriers and how they impact several user profiles.
* Components of Web Accessibility: explains the inter-relation between accessibility features in web technologies such as HTML, in web content, web authoring tools, web browsers, and assistive tools.

**Note**: This is a suggested teaching outline to help achieve the learning outcomes. Instructors might choose to adapt the sequence of the lessons or their content according to the particular audience and context.

### Topic: Stories of people with disabilities

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Provide tangible examples of people with disabilities using the Web. If possible, invite real users to demonstrate how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to interact with the Web. If it is not possible to bring in real people with disabilities, consider using video recordings. If video cannot be used either, use images and story-telling techniques to help illustrate realistic personas and user stories, such as those provided in the teaching materials.

As you may only have time for one or two examples, make sure to emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even with the same type of disability. Also emphasize how design features can enable or disable people. That is, emphasize the social model of disability and avoid using a medical approach. Avoid frequently encountered clich√©s and myths. Complement the few examples that you cover in-depth with some examples of people with other types of disabilities.

**Tip:** Commonly it is helpful to show examples of people using accessible content first, so that students realize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.

**Note:** Later lessons will introduce different types of disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies in more depth. This lesson is primarily intended for firsthand experience of real people, which is often first encounter for students.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding how some individuals with disabilities use the Web.
* Appreciating the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.
* Gaining empathy, inspiration, and motivation for the topic.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

* **Demonstrations**: Invite people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies - this is often the first encounter for students to observe real use of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.
* **Conversational**: Invite people with disabilities for a discussion on their daily experience while using the Web - this is often the first opportunity for students to engage with people with disabilities and to build more empathy.
* **Experiential**: Ask students to try out using assistive technologies as demonstrated by experienced users - this can be a fun way to get an understanding and appreciations for different ways of interacting with the Web.

#### Suggested activities 

Ask students to try and follow along an experienced user using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. For example, using text to speech, speech recognition, and other accessibility features built into their mobile phones.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to reflect on their observations, for example in a short essay (200-300 words). Students should explain some of the design features that one of the assistive technologies they learned about relies on to function.

### Lesson 2: Examples of web accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Provide some basic examples of accessibility barriers and how they impact people with diverse types of disabilities. Emphasize that accessibility barriers impact many people, including people with auditory, cognitive and learning, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Explain how accessibility barriers are created through inadequate design and implementation, and provide examples of accessibility features and repairs.

**Note**: If possible, refer to websites and/or applications that are familiar to students. Emphasize that it is much easier to include accessibility features if they are taken into account from the beginning of the design phases. Provide examples of solutions for the accessibility issues mentioned by referring to the teaching materials for this lesson. Underline the relevance of implementing accessibility solutions for a full inclusion of people with disabilities.

#### Learning outcomes

* Knowledge about a variety of accessibility barriers in the context of web accessibility.
* Knowledge about examples of accessibility repairs.
