## Introduction {.no-display}

This unit builds on the previous unit “What is Web Accessibility.” It explores assistive technologies, adaptive strategies, and accessible design principles in more detail. As well students will consider the inter-dependencies between these components.

## Learning Outcomes

* Identify the broad diversity of people with disabilities
* List different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies
* Explaining some of the major instances of the impact of design decisions on accessibility for people
* Explain some of the inter-dependencies between components of web accessibility

## Prerequisites

***Learners***
:   [Basic] Basic understanding of computers and the Web.

***Instructors***
:   [Advanced] In-depth knowledge of accessibility principles and inclusive design, and expertise in working with people with different types of disabilities.

## Topics to Teach

The following topics help achieve the learning outcomes. You might choose to adapt the sequence of these topics, the activities you carry out, and the homework you provide according to the particular audience and context.

### Topic: Diverse Abilities, Tools, and Strategies

Introduce the wide range of people with disabilities. Explain the wide range of abilities, needs, and preferences within different groups. Consider various needs of those with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. The resource [How People with Disabilities use the Web](#how-people-use-web) provides examples of these.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 

#### Learning outcomes

* Identify diverse types of abilities and related accessibility needs
* Differentiate between assistive technologies and adaptive strategies and list some of them
* Describe some related accessibility design features and barriers

#### Duration

Approximately 2-3 hours depending on demonstrations, interaction, and activities.

#### Teaching Ideas

* Ask students to think about relatives, friends, or colleagues with disabilities that they may have. Ask students to reflect on how their acquaintances interact with digital technology. Complete the information of students where necessary.
* Guide students to focus on the abilities of people with disabilities and on how technology is part of their every day life. Coach students towards thinking about the people rather than their particular medical conditions.
* Present some assistive technologies and adaptive strategies, such as captions, text customization (eg. font size, color, spacing, etc.), specialized keyboards, audio descriptions, screen readers, and screen magnifiers.
* Encourage learners to try some adaptive strategies by exploring different settings in web browsers and operating systems.
* Demonstrate use of assistive technology by experienced users, to avoid misunderstanding (these tools can be complex and not intended for casual use). Ask them to show the difference between accessible and inaccessible content.
* Discuss the accessibility features and barriers with the students, to help them understand the impact of design decisions on people with disabilities every day.

**Tip**: While it is important to introduce different types of disabilities, avoid focusing on these medical aspects. Ensure that students understand that barriers are caused by design decisions rather than by the disability.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to explore the use assistive technologies to perform a task, such as reading the news, making a purchase, interacting in social networks, etc. Instruct them that their experiences are not that of an everyday user.

### Topic: Components of Web Accessibility

Explain that web accessibility involves inter-dependent components, such as content, browsers, and authoring tools, each having their own responsibilities for the overall accessible user experience. Introduce the web accessibility standards from W3C and explain how they address accessibility in different components. The resource [Essential Components of Web Accessibility](#components) explains these components and their inter-dependencies.


{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* Identify some of the inter-dependencies between components for accessibility
* Differentiate the inter-dependencies between digital accessibility, content technologies, and tools
* Describe how each of these components contribute to accessibility
* Describe the existence of W3C standards referring to different components of web accessibility

#### Teaching Ideas

* Based on the previously taught topics, ask students to reflect on the inter-dependencies between assistive technologies, adaptive strategies, and digital content. Guide them to realize how one relies on the other.
* Explore with students some of the accessibility features built into content technologies, such as HTML; for example headings and lists. Ask students to reflect on how these relate to prior observations they made.
* Ask students to reflect on the roles of browsers and media players; for example if a media player does not support captions or audio descriptions. Encourage them to explore accessibility support in different tools.
* Ask students to reflect on the role of authoring tools, such as Content Management Systems (CMS); for example, does their preferred social media platform provide options to provide text alternatives for images?
* Encourage students to think about potential options to improve accessibility in different situations, for example by using another browser, exploring plug-ins for browsers and authoring tools, and requiring accessibility during procurement.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to reflect on specific types of accessibility features and barriers, and how they related to the different components of web accessibility.

## Ideas for Assessment

* Learners should be able to explain different types of accessibility features, such as colors with good contrast, types of barriers, and types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies.  
*(Note: focus questions on functional aspects of accessibility rather than on medical conditions of people)*
* Learners should be able to demonstrate what they have learned from exploring assistive tools and adaptive strategies, such as explaining different settings they found in their web browser.

## Suggested Teaching Resources

* <a id="people-use-web" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> &mdash; provides stories of people with diverse disabilities using the Web; enumerates different types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* <a id='perspectives' href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/">Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)</a> &mdash; series of 10 videos, each of around 1 minute duration, that highlight different types of accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities and other users. For example, one video introduces colors with good contrast and how it benefits many people.
* <a id="better-web-browsing" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing">(Work in progress) Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer</a> &mdash; provides references to resources to help users customize their particular web browser and computer setup, to improve their accessibility experience. It lists different types of settings and assistive tools that are available on different systems.
* <a id="components" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/">Essential Components of Web Accessibility</a> &mdash; explains key terms, and the inter-relation between different components of web accessibility (e.g., web technologies, authoring tools, browsers, etc.).

## Notes

* **Ethical considerations** &mdash; Consider the appropriate ethical aspects when working with people (also when showing videos of people); for example, ensure consent, provide compensation, and avoid patronizing behavior.
* **clichés and myths** &mdash; Unfortunately there are clichés, myths, and even stigmatization of people with disabilities, which could be unintentionally reinforced. Experienced instructors are recommended.
* **Cultural aspects** &mdash; The definition of disability and the approach to accessibility varies between different cultures. This can impact the initial level of awareness and acceptance for the topic by learners.
