## Suggested Teaching Outline

This is a suggested teaching outline to help achieve the learning outcomes. Instructors might choose to adapt the sequence of the topics or their content according to the particular audience and context.

{% include excol.html type="start" %} 

### Topic: Diverse abilities, tools, and barriers

{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 

* Introduce examples of specific types of disabilities, including people with auditory, cognitive and learning, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.
* Introduce some of the design and implementation barriers that people encounter.
* Relate some of these barriers to personal experiences in using the Web, such as being overwhelmed by the content or confused by the navigation etc.
* Emphasize how every individual is unique.

**Tip**: As this lesson might become too medical at a first approach, focus on the fact that barriers are not caused by the disability itself but, instead, by bad implementations at a software or product level.

#### Learning outcomes

* Knowledge about the different types of disabilities.
* Awareness on the most common implementation barriers.
* Knowledge about how to relate such barriers with personal experiences of people with disabilities.

#### Approximate duration

1 hour.

{% endcomment %}

#### Suggested teaching methods

**Presentational**: - Provide a description on the types of disabilities that exist. Emphasize how these types of disabilities are not limiting but, on the contrary, can raise other capabilities of the person.

{% include excol.html type="end" %} 

{% include excol.html type="start" %} 

### Topic: Assistive tools and adaptive strategies

{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 

* Provide an opportunity for learners to experience some types of assistive tools, such as a screen reader, and adaptive strategies, such as changing fonts and colors.
* Demonstrate use by experienced users of access technology, to avoid misunderstanding of the tools (assistive tools can be very complex and not intended for casual use).
* Encourage learners to explore different settings in web browsers and operating systems.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding how an assistive technology works and how it renders information to the user.
* Knowledge of firsthand usage of an assistive technology by trying different operating systems and settings.
* Knowledge of firsthand usage of different adaptive strategies such as changing fonts or colors and applying custom style sheets.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

* **Presentational**: Elaborate on the most well-known assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that exist today: screen readers, screen magnifiers; captions, audio descriptions, braille, etc.
* **Demonstrations:** - Have experienced assistive technology users demonstrating the tools first. Ask them to use already accessible contents so that students can perceive the advantages of developing and designing in an accessible way.

{% include excol.html type="end" %} 

## Suggested Teaching Methods
**Experiential** &mdash; Provide opportunity for learners to experience real people and tools. If possible, invite people with disabilities or show videos. Accompanying explanation and guidance is still required.

## Suggested Teaching Materials

* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> &mdash; provides stories of people with diverse disabilities using the Web; enumerates different types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/">Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)</a> &mdash; series of 10 videos, each of around 1 minute duration, that highlight different types of accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities and other users. For example, one video introduces colors with good contrast and how it benefits many people.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing">(Work in progress) Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer</a> &mdash; provides references to resources to help users customize their particular web browser and computer setup, to improve their accessibility experience. It lists different types of settings and assistive tools that are available on different systems.

## Ideas for Assessment

* **Knowledge Questions** &mdash; Learners should be able to explain different types of accessibility features, such as colors with good contrast, types of barriers, and types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies. <br /><em>(Note: focus questions on functional aspects of accessibility rather than on medical conditions of people)</em>
* **Demonstrations** &mdash; Learners should be able to demonstrate what they have learned from exploring assistive tools and adaptive strategies, such as explaining different settings they found in their web browser.

## Notes

* **Ethical considerations** &mdash; Consider the appropriate ethical aspects when working with people (also when showing videos of people); for example, ensure consent, provide compensation, and avoid patronizing behavior.
* **clichés and myths** &mdash; Unfortunately there are clichés, myths, and even stigmatization of people with disabilities, which could be unintentionally reinforced. Experienced instructors are recommended.
* **Cultural aspects** &mdash; The definition of disability and the approach to accessibility varies between different cultures. This can impact the initial level of awareness and acceptance for the topic by learners.
