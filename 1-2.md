## Introduction

Provide examples on the wide range of diverse abilities of people, explain some of the barriers that people encounter when interacting with the Web, and provide an overview on assistive technologies and adaptive strategies relating them to design features by referring to the [[How People with Disabilities use the Web]](#how-people-use-web) resource.
Introduce other essential components for Web Accessibility and explain how they interrelate with each other by referring to the [[Essential Components of Web Accessibility]](#components) resource. Mention the role of accessibility standards for each of these components to provide guidelines that ensure accessibility characteristics are implemented.

## Suggested Teaching Outline

This is a suggested teaching outline to help achieve the learning outcomes. You might choose to adapt the sequence of the topics or their content according to the particular audience and context.

{% include excol.html type="start" %} 

### Topic: Diverse abilities, tools, and strategies

{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 

Introduce examples of specific types of disabilities together with some of the design and implementation barriers that people encounter. Relate some of these barriers to adaptive strategies and assistive tools used by individuals with disabilities. Provide an opportunity for learners to experience some types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies.

#### Learning outcomes

* Knowledge about the different types of disabilities that exist.
* Awareness on some implementation barriers that impact accessibility.
* Knowledge about how to relate such barriers with personal experiences of people with disabilities.
* Knowledge of firsthand usage of different adaptive strategies such as changing fonts or colors and applying custom style sheets.
* Knowledge of firsthand usage of an assistive technology by trying different operating systems and settings.

#### Approximate duration

1 hour.

#### Suggested teaching methods

* Explain the types of disabilities that exist. Emphasize how these types of disabilities are not limiting but, on the contrary, can raise other capabilities of the person.
* Elaborate on the most well-known assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that exist today: screen readers, screen magnifiers; captions, audio descriptions, braille, etc.
* Demonstrate use by experienced users of access technology, to avoid misunderstanding of the tools (assistive tools can be very complex and not intended for casual use). Ask them to use already accessible contents so that students can perceive the advantages of developing and designing in an accessible way.
* Encourage learners to explore different settings in web browsers and operating systems.

**Tip**: As this lesson might become too medical at a first approach, focus on the fact that barriers are not caused by the disability itself but, instead, by bad implementations at a software or product level.

#### Suggested homework ##

Ask students to use adaptive strategies or assistive technologies to perform a task of their choice, e.g., reading the news, making a purchase, interacting in social networks, etc. Ask them to write a short essay in which they relate their experience using these tools and to comment on whether they have also used some kind of adaptive strategy.

### Topic: Components of Web Accessibility

Explain that Web Accessibility is made up of several components, each having their own influence for the overall accessible user experience.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 

#### Learning Outcomes

* Understanding the inter-relations between web accessibility, web technologies, and web components.
* Awareness of some accessibility features and barriers that are caused by these web technologies and components.

#### Suggested teaching activities

* Explain the inter-relations between accessibility features in web technologies such as HTML, in web content, web authoring tools, web browsers, and assistive tools.
* Promote discussion among students on how web accessibility is built by several web technologies and components working together. Encourage them to give examples of these inter-relations in the context of their daily tasks and overall experience.

#### Suggested homework##

Ask students to write a short essay in which they enumerate the different components of web accessibility that have been introduced. Ask them to specifically mention some barriers and features that might depend on each of the listed components.

{% include excol.html type="end" %} 

## Ideas for Assessment

* **Knowledge Questions** &mdash; Learners should be able to explain different types of accessibility features, such as colors with good contrast, types of barriers, and types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies. <br /><em>(Note: focus questions on functional aspects of accessibility rather than on medical conditions of people)</em>
* **Demonstrations** &mdash; Learners should be able to demonstrate what they have learned from exploring assistive tools and adaptive strategies, such as explaining different settings they found in their web browser.

## Suggested Teaching Materials

* <a id="people-use-web" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> &mdash; provides stories of people with diverse disabilities using the Web; enumerates different types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* <a id='perspectives' href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/">Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)</a> &mdash; series of 10 videos, each of around 1 minute duration, that highlight different types of accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities and other users. For example, one video introduces colors with good contrast and how it benefits many people.
* <a id="better-web-browsing" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing">(Work in progress) Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer</a> &mdash; provides references to resources to help users customize their particular web browser and computer setup, to improve their accessibility experience. It lists different types of settings and assistive tools that are available on different systems.
* <a id="components" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/">Essential Components of Web Accessibility</a> &mdash; explains key terms, and the inter-relation between different components of web accessibility (eg. web technologies, authoring tools, browsers, etc.).

## Notes

* **Ethical considerations** &mdash; Consider the appropriate ethical aspects when working with people (also when showing videos of people); for example, ensure consent, provide compensation, and avoid patronizing behavior.
* **clichés and myths** &mdash; Unfortunately there are clichés, myths, and even stigmatization of people with disabilities, which could be unintentionally reinforced. Experienced instructors are recommended.
* **Cultural aspects** &mdash; The definition of disability and the approach to accessibility varies between different cultures. This can impact the initial level of awareness and acceptance for the topic by learners.
