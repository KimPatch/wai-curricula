## Introduction

This page provides further guidance on how to build different types of courses using the [WAI-Curricula](https;//www.w3.org/WAI/curricula/) resource. It contains:

* Definitions and explanations of main terms used in the curriculum [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/curricula/introduction-to-web-accessibility/).
* Examples of different course types (including formal, informal, vocational, and academic) and formats (including MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and face-to-face courses).
* Estimated duration for each of the examples based on their type and format.

## Types of Courses

### University Course

Courses at university translate their duration into a credit system. There are several systems around the world, for example, the ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System), and the American Credit System. One ECTS credit corresponds to 25-30 hours of students' workload. 60 credits reflect a complete year of work.

The below is an estimate of how many ECTS credits will be advised for [Introduction to Web Accessibility](/curricula/introduction-to-web-accessibility/) for a whole semester.

| Title | European CREDITS |
| --- | --- |
| Module 1: What is Web Accessibility | 0,5 |
| Module 2: People and Digital Technology | 0,5 |
| Module 3: Business Case and Benefits | 0,5 |
| Module 4: Principles, Guidelines, and Checks | 0,5 |
| Module 5: Applying and Managing Accessibility | 0,5 |
| Total | 2,5 |

### Consultancy Agency Course

The following is an estimate for a one week course on web accessibility.

| Title | Duration (days) |
| --- | --- |
| Module 1: What is Web Accessibility | 1 |
| Module 2: People and Digital Technology | 1 |
| Module 3: Business Case and Benefits | 0.5 |
| Module 4: Principles, Guidelines and Checks | 1.5 |
| Module 5: Applying and Managing Accessibility | 1 |
| Total | 5 |

### MOOC Course

Another example of such a consultancy course could be a 24-hour MOOC course. Estimate duration would look as follows:

| Title | Duration (hours) |
| --- | --- |
| Module 1: What is Web Accessibility | 5 |
| Module 2: People and Digital Technology | 5 |
| Module 3: Business Case and Benefits | 2 |
| Module 4: Principles, Guidelines and Checks | 8 |
| Module 5: Applying and Managing Accessibility | 4 |
| Total | 24 |
