## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Simple Tables

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Define simple tables as those which contain one row or column header. Explain use of HTML elements to mark up tables, table headers,
and table cells. Explain that table markup is used by text-to-speech technologies to help people orient and navigate tables.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain the purpose and scope of  simple tables
* mark up tables using the HTML element `table`
* mark up table headers using the HTML element `th`
* mark up table data cells using the HTML element `td`
* explain how table markup allow text-to-speech technologies to associate information in header and data cells
* explain how table markup can be displayed using custom style sheets or different screen sizes

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Define simple tables as those which contain one row or column header. Explain that speech and mainstream technologies can associate information in the header and data cells if they are marked up appropriately. Examples of simple tables are provided in the WAI website tutorials, [Tables with one header](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/one-header/).
* Show examples of use of the HTML elements `table`, `th`, and `td`. Explain that `table` is used to mark up the table layer, `th` is used to code header cells, and `td` is used to code data cells. For examples on how to mark up a simple table, refer to technique [H51: Using table markup to present tabular data](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H51).
* Demonstrate use of voice commands, keystrokes, or gestures provided byspeech and mainstream technologies to navigate web pages through tables, and to move between cells in a table. Explore advanced functionality that some tools provide, such as presenting all tables in a list where users can select the table they are interested in. Examples on how people with disabilities interact with the web are provided in [Stories of Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/).
* Provide examples of alternative renderings for tables, such as splitting the table into several lists, or showing only parts of the table in a mobile viewport.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked which HTML elements are needed to mark up a table structure. Assess students' knowledge of the HTML elements `table`, `th`, and `td`.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a simple table and are asked to identify its headers and code them using the `th` element. Assess students' understanding of the `th` element.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Complex Tables

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Define complex tables as those which contain multiple row and column headers. Explain use of additional techniques to convey structure and layout for complex tables. For example, the HTML elements `colgroup` and the attributes `scope` and `headers`.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain the scope and purpose of complex tables
* mark up the direction of the headers using the HTML attribute `scope`
* mark up headers that span several columns using the HTML elements `col` and  `colgroup`
* mark up headers that span multiple rows using the HTML element `tbody`
* code irregular headers for cells using the attribute `headers`

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Explain that complex tables have column or row headers that span through several columns or rows. Indicate that assistive technologies may not interpret the direction and scope of such headers, so it is necessary to explicitly associate header cells and data cells.
* Demonstrate use of the HTML attribute `scope` and its values `row` and `column` to code the direction of the headers. Examples on how to use the HTML attribute `scope` are provided in the WAI website tutorials, [Tables with two headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tabular-information/two-headers/).
* Show examples of headers that span multiple rows or columns. Explain how to code them using the HTML elements `col`, `colgroup`, `thead` and `tbody`, as well as the attributes `colspan`, `rowspan`, and `rowgroup`. Examples on how to code headers that span several rows or columns are provided in the WAI website tutorials, [Tables with irregular headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tabular-information/irregular/).
* Show examples of uses of the `header` attribute to associate more than two headers that relate to the same cell. Explain that when this attribute is used, each of the header cells needs to have a unique id reference. The ids of the corresponding header cells need to be separated by spaces in the value of the `headers` attribute. Examples on how to use the `headers` attribute are provided in the WAI website tutorials, [Tables with multi-level headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tabular-information/multi-level/).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short answer questions &mdash; Students are asked how table headers that span several rows or columns are coded in HTML. Assess students' knowledge of the HTML elements to code multiple row or column headers.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a table containing headers that span several columns or rows and are asked to code them. Assess how students use the HTML elements `th`, `col`, `tbody`, and the attribute `scope` to indicate the scope of the table header and convey their direction.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with an irregular table and are asked to provide its headers using the attribute `headers`. Assess how students use the attribute `headers` in data cells together with its corresponding id references in the table headers.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Table Summary and Description

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain use of HTML elements and WAI-ARIA attributes to provide information about the purpose of a table. Mention that providing descriptions for a table is a shared responsibility among different team members: content authors, designers, and developers.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code additional information to understand the structure and layout of the table using:
  * the HTML element `caption`
  * the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`
  * the HTML elements `figure` and `figcaption`
  * the HTML attribute `summary`
* describe complimentary requirements for authoring table descriptions

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Show examples of use of the HTML element `caption` to provide descriptions for the purpose of a table. Mention that it needs to be the first child of the element `table` and that its contents are visible for all users by default. Examples on how to use the element `caption` are provided in technique [H39: Using caption elements to associate data table captions with data tables](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H39).
* Explain use of methods to provide further details about the structure and contents of a table. For example, the HTML elements `figure` and `figcaption`, and the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`. Explain that the element `table` needs to be wrapped by the element `figure`, and that the element `figcaption` containing the text needs to be the first child of the element `figure`.  Examples on how to provide a table summaryare provided in the WAI website tutorials, [Caption and summary](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tabular-information/caption-summary/).
* Explain use of the attribute `summary` to provide screen reader users with detailed information about the structure of complex tables. Emphasize that it is obsolete according to the HTML5 specification, thus its use is only advisable for fallback purposes. Examples on how to use the attribute `summary` are provided in technique [H73: Using the summary attribute of the table element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H73).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a table and are asked to provide mechanisms for authors to add a short text to describe its purpose. Assess students' understanding of the `caption` element to describe the purpose of a table.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a complex table and are asked to include mechanisms for authors to provide extended details about its contents and overall structure. Assess students' knowledge of HTML elements and attributes to provide table summaries.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are directed to a web page where there are several tables and are asked to explore them using an accessibility evaluation extension. Then they are asked how many tables they have found and which their headers are. Assess how students analyze if a table is coded appropriately to reflect its structure.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students add tables to the website they are building. Assess how students code table headers and table cells, as well as how they provide a table caption and additional descriptions for tables.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a table with neither visual nor programmatic headers. Then they are asked to figure them out and decide if the table could be considered simple or complex. Assess how students identify table headers and distinguish between simple and complex tables.
