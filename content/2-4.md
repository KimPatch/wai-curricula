## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Navigating Tabular Information

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce strategies that people use to navigate tables. Mention that there might be different ways in which information in a table can be presented depending on user requirements.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe how people access information in tables using:
  * Screen reader keystrokes to review one cell at a time.
  * Custom stylesheets or different screen sizes to display table data in an alternative format.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Invite students to try out screen readers to move through the different cells of a table. Introduce specific keystrokes to go to adjacent cells in a row or column. Indicate that information on the data cells is associated with that of the header cells and both are spoken sequentially. Explain that information on the data cells is spoken before or after that on the header cell depending on the screen reader. Mention that column headers are spoken when moving to the next or prior column, and row headers are spoken when moving to the next or prior row.
* Provide examples of alternative renderings for tables, such as splitting the table into several lists, or showing only parts of the table in a mobile viewport.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Research &mdash; Students research screen readers' documentation to find the keystrokes allowing to move through the different table cells. Assess students' understanding of the different screen readers functions to move through the table cells.
* Practical &mdash; Students navigate an accessible table using their screen reader of choice. Assess how students identify header and data cells as they are spoken by the screen reader.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a table and are asked to split it into several nested lists. Assess how students communicate the underlying structure of the table regardless of its visual appearance.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Associating Information

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Discuss techniques to associate header and data cells within tables. For example, `th` and `td` elements, or the `headers` attribute.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Identify and mark up simple and complex tables.
* Mark up headers and data cells with the `th` and `td` elements respectively.
* Clarify the direction of the headers with the `scope` attribute.
* Code irregular headers for cells in complex tables with the `headers` attribute.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Explain the difference between simple and complex tables. Indicate that simple tables have their headers in the left column and in the top row, whereas complex tables have more than one column or row header.
* Introduce the `th` and `td` elements. Explain that `th` elements are used to denote header cells, whereas `td` elements are used to denote data cells.
* Introduce the `scope` attribute and its values (`row` and `column`) to indicate the direction of the headers.
* Introduce the `headers` attribute of a data cell to handle irregular headers. Explain that when this attribute is used, each of the header cells need to have a unique id reference. The ids of the corresponding header cells need to be separated by spaces in the value of the `headers` attribute.
* Explain that associating information is a WCAG requirement under success criterion [1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#info-and-relationships).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short answer questions &mdash; Students are asked how table headers and cells are coded in HTML. Assess students knowledge of the HTML elements to structure tables.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a table with neither visual nor programmatic headers. Then they are asked to figure them out and decide if the table could be considered simple or complex. Assess how students identify table headers and distinguish between simple and complex tables.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a simple table and are asked to identify its headers and code them with the `th` element. Assess students's understanding of the `th` element.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a table containing several column or row headers and are asked to code them appropriately. Assess how students use the `th` and `scope` elements to indicate table header cells and convey their direction.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with an irregular table and are asked to provide its headings. Assess how students use the `headers` attribute in data cells together with its corresponding id references in the table headers.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Meta Information for a Table

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce techniques to provide information about the purpose of the table. Mention additional techniques to explain structure and layout for complex tables.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Code additional information to help users understand the structure and layout of the table with:
  * The `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` attributes.
  * The `figure` and `figcaption` elements.
  * The `summary` element.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Introduce the `caption` element. Explain that it can be used to provide descriptions for the purpose of the table. Mention that it needs to be the first child of the `table` element and that its contents are visible for all users by default.
* Introduce additional methods to provide further details about the structure and contents of the table. For example, the `figure` and `figcaption` elements, and the `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` attributes. Explain that the `table` element needs to be wrapped by the `figure` element, and that the `figcaption` containing the text needs to be the first child of the `figure` element.
* Explain that the `summary` element was designed to provide screen reader users with detailed information about the structure of complex tables. Emphasize that it is not part of the HTML5 specification, thus its use is not advisable.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a table and are asked to provide mechanisms for authors to add a short text to describe its purpose. Assess students' understanding of the `caption` element to describe the purpose of a table.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a complex table and are asked to include mechanisms for authors to provide extended details about its contents and overall structure. Assess students' knowledge of the above-mentioned methods to provide additional descriptions for tables.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are directed to a web page where there are several tables and are asked to explore them using an accessibility evaluation extension. Then they are asked how many tables there are in the web page, how many rows and columns each table has, which their headers are. Assess how students analyze if a table is coded appropriately to reflect its structure.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students add tables to the website they are building. Assess hos students code table headers and table cells, as well as how they provide a table caption and additional descriptions for tables when needed.

## Teaching Resources
