## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module:

* Introduce how several groups of users interact with accessible tables.
* Introduce some code-based solutions to differentiate types of cells and to provide titles and descriptions for tables.

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* Identify various strategies for users to navigate and understand information presented in tables.
* Recognize some structural components of a table.
* Distinguish between simple and complex tables.
* Demonstrate knowledge about techniques to programmatically associate data cells and header cells.
* Provide meaningful names and descriptions for tables by means of the `caption` and `summary` elements.
* Determine if a given table meets success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) of WCAG.

## Competencies

Skills required for this module.

Students:

* Basic understanding of:
  * Accessibility concepts and terminology.
  * How people with disabilities use the Web.
  * HTML elements for grouping contents.

Instructors:

* In-depth knowledge of:
  * How people with disabilities use the Web (including assistive technologies and adaptive strategies).
  * The links between components of web accessibility.
  * Accessibility principles.  
  * The W3C accessibility standards.
* Experience with:
  * HTML elements for grouping content.
  * `Caption` and `Summary` elements.

## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Navigating Tabular Information

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce strategies that some people use to navigate tables. Mention that there might be different ways in which information in a table can be presented depending on user requirements.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Recognize the ability of assistive technology users to review one cell at a time using specific key combinations.
* Recognize how header cells are spoken before or after data cells by assistive technologies as users move between cells.
* Acknowledge that some people may use custom stylesheets or different screen sizes to display table data.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

#### Topic: Contextual Information for Tables

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce techniques to provide information about the purpose and functionality of the table. Mention additional techniques to explain structure and layout for complext tables.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Use the `caption` element to describe the purpose and function of the table.
* Use the `summary` element to provide additional information that helps users understand the structure and layout of the table.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Associating Information

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Provide information about techniques to associate header and data cells within tables.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Distinguish between simple and complex tables.
* Use the `th` and `td` elements to denote headers and data cells.
* Use the `scope` atribute to clarify the direction of the headers.
* Use the `headers` attribute to define custom headers for cells in complex tables.

## Teaching Resources

Suggested resources to support your teaching:

* [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/people-use-web/) &mdash; Provides stories of people with disabilities using the Web; describes types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* [Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)](/perspective-videos/) &mdash; Is a series of 1-minute videos that demonstrate that web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. They show accessibility features, how they impact people with disabilities, and how they benefit everyone in a variety of situations.
* [WAI Web Accessibility Tutorials (Tables)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables) &mdash; shows how to develop web content that is accessible to people with disabilities, and that provides a better user experience for everyone
* WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [ARIA can both cloak and enhance](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices#principle-2-aria-can-both-cloak-and-enhance-creating-both-power-and-danger) section &mdash; provides readers with an understanding of how to use WAI-ARIA to create accessible rich internet applications. 
* HTML5 Specification's [3.2.1 Semantics](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#semantics-2) &mdash;
