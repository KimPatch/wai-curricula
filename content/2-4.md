## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Simple Tables

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain strategies that people with disabilities use to navigate simple tables, such as moving around adjacent cells. Mention that there might be different ways in which information in a table can be presented depending on user requirements.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Identify simple tables.
* Describe how people access information in simple tables using:
  * Screen reader keystrokes to review one cell at a time.
  * Screen readers functions that present an isolated list of all the tables in a page.
  * Custom stylesheets or different screen sizes to display table data in an alternative format.
* Mark up table headers with the `th` element.
* Mark up data cells with the `td` element.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Invite students to try out screen readers to move through the different cells of a table. Demonstrate use of specific keystrokes to go to adjacent cells in a row or column. Indicate that information on the data cells is associated with that of the header cells and both are spoken sequentially. Explain that information on the data cells is spoken before or after that on the header cell depending on the screen reader. Mention that column headers are spoken when moving to the next or previous column, and row headers are spoken when moving to the next or previous row.
* Provide examples of alternative renderings for tables, such as splitting the table into several lists, or showing only parts of the table in a mobile viewport.
* Show examples of use of the `th` and `td` elements. Explain that `th` elements are used to code header cells, whereas `td` elements are used to code data cells. For reference on how to mark up a simple table, refer to technique [H51: Using table markup to present tabular data](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H51).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Research &mdash; Students research screen readers' documentation to find keystrokes to move through the different table cells. Assess students' understanding of the different screen readers' functions to move through the table cells.
* Practical &mdash; Students navigate an accessible table using their screen reader of choice. Assess how students identify header and data cells as they are spoken by the screen reader.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a simple table and are asked to identify its headers and code them with the `th` element. Assess students' understanding of the `th` element.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Complex Tables

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain use of additional techniques to convey structure and layout for complex tables. For example, the element `colgroup` and the attributes `scope` and `headers`.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Identify complex tables.
* Mark up the direction of the headers with the `scope` attribute.
* Mark up headers that expand several columns using the `colgroup` element.
* Mark up headers that expand multiple rows using the `tbody` element.
* Code irregular headers for cells using the `headers` attribute.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Explain the complex tables have more than one column or row header that expand through several columns or rows. Indicate that assistive technologies may not interpret the direction and scope of such headers, so it is necessary to explicitly associate header cells and data cells.
* Demonstrate use of the attribute `scope` and its values `row` and `column` to indicate the direction of the headers. For reference on how to use the `scope` attribute, see the WAI website tutorials [Tables with two headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/two-headers/).
* Show examples of headers that expand multiple rows or columns and how to code them using the elements `colgroup` and `tbody`. For reference on how to code headers that expand several rows or columns, see the WAI website tutorials [Irregular headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/irregular/).
* Show examples of uses of the `header` attribute to associate more than two headers that relate to the same cell. Explain that when this attribute is used, each of the header cells needs to have a unique id reference. The ids of the corresponding header cells need to be separated by spaces in the value of the `headers` attribute. For reference on how to use the `headers` attribute, see the WAI website tutorials, [Tables with multi-level headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/multi-level/).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short answer questions &mdash; Students are asked how table headers that expand several rows or columns are coded in HTML. Assess students' knowledge of the HTML elements to code multiple row or column headers.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a table containing headers that expand several columns or rows and are asked to code them appropriately. Assess how students use the elements `th`, `col`, `tbody`, and the attribute `scope` to indicate the scope of the table header and convey their direction.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with an irregular table and are asked to provide its headers. Assess how students use the `headers` attribute in data cells together with its corresponding id references in the table headers.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Meta Information for a Table

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain use of HTML elements and techniques to provide information about the purpose of a table.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Code additional information to understand the structure and layout of the table using:
  * The `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` attributes.
  * The `figure` and `figcaption` elements.
  * The `summary` attribute.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Show examples of use of the `caption` element to provide descriptions for the purpose of the table. Mention that it needs to be the first child of the `table` element and that its contents are visible for all users by default. For examples about how to use the caption` element, see technique [H39: Using caption elements to associate data table captions with data tables](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H39).
* Explain additional methods to provide further details about the structure and contents of a table. For example, the `figure` and `figcaption` elements, and the `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` attributes. Explain that the `table` element needs to be wrapped by the `figure` element, and that the `figcaption` containing the text needs to be the first child of the `figure` element. For reference on several ways to provide a table summary, see the WAI website tutorials, [Caption and summary](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/caption-summary/).
* Explain use of the `summary` attribute to provide screen reader users with detailed information about the structure of complex tables. Emphasize that it is obsolete according to the HTML5 specification, thus its use is not advisable. For examples about how to use the `summary` attribute, see technique [H73: Using the summary attribute of the table element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H73

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a table and are asked to provide mechanisms for authors to add a short text to describe its purpose. Assess students' understanding of the `caption` element to describe the purpose of a table.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a complex table and are asked to include mechanisms for authors to provide extended details about its contents and overall structure. Assess students' knowledge of HTML elements and attributes to provide table summaries.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are directed to a web page where there are several tables and are asked to explore them using an accessibility evaluation extension. Then they are asked how many tables they have found and which their headers are. Assess how students analyze if a table is coded appropriately to reflect its structure.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students add tables to the website they are building. Assess how students code table headers and table cells, as well as how they provide a table caption and additional descriptions for tables.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a table with neither visual nor programmatic headers. Then they are asked to figure them out and decide if the table could be considered simple or complex. Assess how students identify table headers and distinguish between simple and complex tables.
