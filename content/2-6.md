## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Extending Semantics

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain how accessibility properties can be added or removed using the appropriate DOM methods. Show examples of accessibility properties such as accessible name and description and explain how they are rendered in the accessibility tree. 

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain how the accessibility tree can be modified using HTML, CSS, WAI-ARIA, and JavaScript
* code additions or removals from  the accessibility properties of a given object using the appropriate DOM methods
* code accessibility roles of custom widgets using WAI-ARIA roles
* code additional semantics for DOM nodes using WAI-ARIA states and properties when HTML elements cannot convey enough semantic information

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Show how WAI-ARIA can be used to complement the semantics of the host language where it is applied. Explain that the WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties override the semantics expressed by the native elements. Emphasize that WAI-ARIA does not substitute existing semantics of host languages where it is used, but it complements and expands them. Explain that these properties may not be well supported by assistive technologies, so checking its current accessibility support is recommended. For examples of common uses of WAI-ARIA in custom widgets, see [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/).
* Show examples of DOM methods to modify properties of DOM objects. Show the accessibility tree generated based on that DOM. Explain that the accessibility tree is a representation of all the accessibility properties based on a particular DOM.
* Show examples of WAI-ARIA roles applied to different types of custom widgets. For example, `button`, `list`, `listitem`, and `checkbox`. Explain how these roles help assistive technologies interpret the purpose of the widget. For reference on  different design patterns and widgets, see the WAI-ARIA authoring practices, [Design Patterns and widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#x3-design-patterns-and-widgets).
* Explain use of supported states and properties of WAI-ARIA in different applications, such as `pressed`, `level`, `haspopup`. Mention that state values are more likely to change due to user interaction, whereas property values are meant to last through the widget's life-cycle. For reference on the WAI-ARIA states and properties, see the WAI-ARIA specification, [Supported states and properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#states_and_properties).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked about the different categories of roles that exist in the WAI-ARIA specification. Assess students' knowledge of the different types of roles in the WAI-ARIA specification.
* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked how they can access the accessibility tree and how its properties can be added or removed. Assess students' knowledge of accessibility properties as well as methods to ad or remove them.
* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked about the difference between accessible names, descriptions, roles, and states. Assess students' knowledge of the different types of accessibility properties.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with different custom widgets and are asked to determine which accessibility properties they should have. Assess how students relate accessibility properties with real examples of custom widgets.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Custom Buttons

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Show examples of accessible custom buttons and explain how to code them.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code accessible names for buttons using  the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-label`or `aria-labelledby`
* code custom buttons so that they are keyboard focusable using `tabindex="0"`
* code functionality of custom buttons so that it is operable by keyboard interfaces using event listeners that respond to keyboard presses
* code custom buttons that are interpreted correctly by assistive technologies using the WAI-ARIA `role="button‚Äù`

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Custom List Boxes

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate use of appropriate focus management techniques to make a custom listbox operable through keyboard interfaces. Explain use of WAI-ARIA roles and properties to mark up custom listboxes so that they are interpreted appropriately by assistive technologies.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* mark up the list widget using the WAI-ARIA `role-"list"`
* code accessible names for list boxes using the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby`
* code focus management within the items of the listbox using adequate keyboard interaction conventions
* mark up options within the listbox using the WAI-ARIA `role="option"`
* mark up currently selected list items using the WAI-ARIA properties `aria-selected` for each of the selected options and `aria-multiselectable="true"` when the widget allows to select multiple list items at a time

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Custom Carousels

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate use of proper structural markup, as well as coding for notifications and keyboard operability for a carousel.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code  meaningful structures for carousels using headings, lists, labels 
* add functionality to move to previous and next slide, as well as to navigate between each of the slides  so that it can be operated using different input methods
* code notifications to warn users about the currently selected slide
	* move focus to the selected slide to help people orient within the carousel

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Modal Windows

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate use of proper markup, structure, focus management, keyboard conventions, and notifications for an accessible modal window

### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code labels and descriptions for modal windows so that they are perceivable by people using assistive technologies
* code focus management so that it remains within the boundaries of a modal window while it is open
* code keyboard behavior for the modal window

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Practical &mdash; Students are asked to select a date from an accessible calendar widget using only the keyboard. Assess students' knowledge of keyboard conventions to interact with complex widgets.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students add custom widgets to the website they are building. Assess students' knowledge of the WAI-ARIA roles and properties to expand semantics of host languages as well as additional states and keyboard conventions to allow for multiple ways of interaction.
