## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Extending Semantics

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Refer back to previous modules to demonstrate how standard HTML widgets implicitly convey accessibility properties by default. Show examples of non-standard widgets, and explain why it is necessary to explicitly add such properties using appropriate DOM methods.

Mention that standard components are always preferred from an accessibility perspective, and that use of non-standard widgets is only recommended when there is no standard alternative.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain how accessible names, descriptions, roles, and states are used by assistive technologies to interpret custom widgets
* explain how the DOM methods allow to modify the accessibility properties of a given object
* code custom widgets using standard HTML to the extent possible
* code accessibility properties of non-standard custom widgets using JavaScript, Dom methods, and WAI-ARIA

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Explain that accessibility properties allow people using assistive technologies to get semantic information about a widget. Mention that widgets requiring extended keyboard interaction make assistive technologies get into application mode, where all keyboard interaction is controled by the author of the widget. Mention that some assistive technologies provide custom hints based on these properties so that people can interact with those widgets more efficiently.
* Show examples of widgets and their accessible names, descriptions, roles, and states. Emphasize that standard widgets inherit these properties by default due to the implicit semantics of some native HTML elements, but non-standard custom widgets need to have these properties expressed explicitly, especially when using HTML elements with no semantic information. Explain that accessibility support for WAI-ARIA properties may vary, so checking its current accessibility support is recommended. Mention that use of ARIA overrides the implicit semancis of native HTML elements where it is used. For an explanation of how WAI-ARIA can provide both powerful and dangerous experiences see the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practice [Read me first](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#no_aria_better_bad_aria).
* Explain use of supported states and properties of WAI-ARIA that can be applied to both standard and non-standard custom widgets to improve their semantic information. For example, `pressed`, `level`, `haspopup`, `expanded`. Mention that state values are more likely to change due to user interaction, whereas property values are meant to last through the widget's life-cycle. For reference on the WAI-ARIA states and properties, see the WAI-ARIA specification, [Supported states and properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#states_and_properties).
* Show examples of WAI-ARIA roles applied to different types of non-standard custom widgets where native HTML elements do not convey enough semantic information. For example, `grid`, `menu`, `menubar`, `tablist`, `tree`, and `treegrid`. Explain that these roles are often the only way to help assistive technologies interpret the purpose of these widgets. For a list of widget roles, see the WAI-ARIA specification [Widget roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#widget_roles).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked about the different widget roles that exist in the WAI-ARIA specification. Assess students' knowledge of the different widget roles in the WAI-ARIA specification.
* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked how they can access the accessibility tree and how its properties can be added or removed. Assess students' knowledge of accessibility properties as well as methods to ad or remove them.
* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked about the difference between WAI-ARIA states and properties. Assess students' knowledge of the differences between states and properties of the WAI-ARIA specification.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with different widgets and are asked to decide if WAI-ARIA needs to be used. For those where WAI-ARIA needs to be used,  they are asked which WAI-ARIA roles and properties they should have. Assess students' understanding of when to use WAI-ARIA.

### Topic: Keyboard Interactions

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain common keyboard interactions for custom widgets as defined in the WAI-ARIA specification, [Composite widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#composite). For example, tabbing, using the arrow keys, or using keyboard shortcuts to perform specific actions.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code DOM order for composite widgets so that it allows for a meaningful sequential focus order
* code the main tab stop for composite widgets using native focusable HTML elements or the attribute `tabindex` in a non-focusable element
* add keyboard events and key bindings to the components of a composite widget to handle focus management within the widget
* explain how keyboard-only and assistive technology users rely on keyboard interactions to operate widgets, such as use of the tab, arrow, or shortcut keys
* summarize related requirements for designers to ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Demonstrate use of focus indicators for users to keep track of where they are as they are interacting with the widget. Mention that providing the specific styles is a shared responsibility among different team members: designers, and developers. For reference on how to make navigation predictable within widgets, see [Discernible and predictable keyboard focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_focus_discernable_predictable).
* Demonstrate use of event listeners that allow for several ways of interaction. For example, keyboard, mouse, and tactile gestures. Emphasize that, in addition to making an element focusable, it is also necessary to take care of all additional functionality, such as which keys need to be pressed to activate it. For a pointer on what functionality needs to be added to a custom widget to allow keyboard functionality, see [A role is a promise](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#a_role_is_a_promise).
* Demonstrate use of the `tabindex` attribute to indicate if an element can or cannot be focusable. Explain use of the value `-1` to mark up an element so that it can be focusable when it becomes visible  or available via scripts. Explain use of the value `0` to make an element focusable and put it in the relative order of the navigation according to the DOM structure. An example of how to use the `tabindex` attribute is provided in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, [Managing focus within components using a roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_roving_tabindex).
* Explain different keyboard interactions to operate widgets. Explain that the tab key moves through the focusable elements of a widget. Explain that the arrow keys move through elements in a list.
* Explain different modes for keyboard interaction such as virtual or application. Explain that in the virtual mode most of the keyboard functionality is provided by browsers and assistive technologies, whereas in the application mode all keystrokes pass directly to the application, and the application needs to provide all keyboard interaction. Emphasize that application modes should only be used when applications are recreating the desktop environment.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked what the values of the `tabindex` element can be and what each of them means. Assess students' knowledge of the `tabindex` element and its values.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a non-standard button and are asked to code it using WAI-ARIA roles, `tabindex` attribute, and event listeners for keyboard, mouse, and tactile devices. Assess students understanding of the different ways in which users can interact with non-standard widgets.

### Topic: States of a Custom Widget

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Describe states that a widget can have, such as `selected`, `pressed`, `expanded`, or `collapsed`. Explain how to make them distinguishable from the `focus` state.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code the `expanded` or `collapsed` states using the `aria-expanded` attribute
* code the `checked` state using the `aria-checked` attribute
* code the `selected` state using `aria-selected`
* code the `pressed` state using `aria-pressed`
* list requirements for designers to style states in a way they are distinguishable

{% comment %}

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Demonstrate use of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-expanded` to convey if associated sections of a widget are visible or hidden. Mention examples of widgets where this attribute can be used, such as menus or accordions. For reference on how to use the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-expanded`, see the WAI-ARIA authoring practices, [Accordion (sections with show/hide functionality)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#accordion).
* Show examples of non-standard checkboxes. Mention use of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-checked` to communicate the state of the checkbox. For reference on how to use the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-checked`, see the WAI-ARIA authoring practices, [Checkbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/checkbox/checkbox-1/checkbox-1.html).
* Demonstrate differences between `focus` and `selected` states, such as those in listboxes or menus. Indicate that a clear distinction should be made between these two states, such as using the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-selected` to convey the state of the selection and applying different styles for each. Mention that providing the specific styles is a shared responsibility among different team members: designers, and developers. For reference on how to communicate the selected state, see the WAI-ARIA authoring practices, [Listbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#Listbox).
* Show examples of toolbars where the `pressed` state is visually conveyed. Indicate that it is necessary to communicate that information using the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-pressed`. For reference on how to code the `pressed` state, see the WAI-ARIA authoring practices, [Toolbar](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/toolbar/toolbar.html).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

* Practical &mdash; Students are asked to make an accordion accessible using `aria-expanded` where applicable. Assess students' understanding of how to code the `expand` and `collapsed` states.
* Practical &mdash; Students are asked to make a non-standard check box accessible using `aria-checked` and `role="checkbox"`. Assess students' understanding of how to code the checked and unchecked states.
* Practical &mdash; Students are asked to code an accessible non-standard list box using the focused and selected states where appropriate. Assess students' understanding of how to code the difference between `focus` and `selected` states.
* Practical &mdash; Students are asked to code an accessible toolbar using \aria-pressed\ when necessary. Assess students' knowledge of how to code the `pressed` state.

### Topic: Dynamic Changes

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain how to notify users about dynamic changes on a page, such as using live regions.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code alerts and warnings on the page using the WAI-ARIA `role="alert"`
* code the regions of the page that contain the dynamic changes using  the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-live`
* mark up the level of priority for the updates using the values `polite`, `assertive`, or `off` in the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-live`
* mark up the region to be announced as a whole or only parts using the  WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-atomic`
* mark up additions, removals, or all changes in the node to be announced using the attribute `aria-relevant`

{% comment %}

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to achieve the learning outcomes.

* Show examples of alerts and warnings on a page, such as a time warning or an error. Explain that these alerts may not be noticed while using assistive technologies, so additional markup is required. For reference on how to code these alerts, see the WAI-ARIA authoring practices [Alert](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/alert/alert.html).
* Show examples of dynamic regions of a web page, such as carousels, chat logs, or feeds. Explain that screen reader users cannot perceive these types of updates by default as they can only be focused at one thing at a time. For reference on how to communicate the changes using `aria-live`, see the WAI-ARIA authoring practices, [Auto-rotating image carousel](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/carousel/carousel-1.html).
* Explain use of the `role="alert"` to mark up a region as dynamic. Show examples of messages that can be included in those regions, such as information about new loaded contents on a page, or about the item that is currently visible within a set of slides.
* Demonstrate use of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-live` together with its values to indicate the priority with which updates are announced. For reference on the meaning of the different values of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-live`, see the WAI-ARIA specification, [`aria-atomic`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-atomic).
* Explain use of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-relevant`  to communicate which changes of the region should be announced: additions, removals, or all. For reference on how to use `aria-relevant`, see the WAI-ARIA specification, [`aria-relevant`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-relevant).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a widget containing an alert and are asked to code it appropriately. Assess students' knowledge of `role="alert"`.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a chat log and are asked to code it appropriately so that it can be understood by users of text-to-speech. Assess students' knowledge of the types of live regions as well as its roles and properties.
