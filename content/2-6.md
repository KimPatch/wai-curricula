## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: WAI-ARIA Specification

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain the purpose and scope of the WAI-Aria specification. Describe its different parts and present some scenarios for its usage, such as expanding native semantics of host languages.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Explain the scope and purpose of the WAI-ARIA specification.
* Distinguish some of its roles, as well as categories of roles.
* Distinguish WAI-ARIA states and properties.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Define WAI-Aria as a set of roles, states, properties, and values to improve the accessibility of web content and applications. Emphasize that it does not substitute existing semantics of host languages where it is used, but complements and expands them.
* Explain use of different types of roles. For example, landmark, widget, document structure, or window roles. For reference on the different categories of WAI-ARIA roles, see the WAI-ARIA specification, [Categorization of roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles_categorization).
* Explain use of supported states and properties of WAI-ARIA. Mention that state values are more likely to change due to user interaction, whereas property values are meant to last through the application life-cycle. For reference on the WAI-ARIA states and properties, see the WAI-ARIA specification, [Supported states and properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#states_and_properties).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

[To be developed].

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Programmatic and Visual Focus

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain how to add or remove focus to widgets that are not focusable by default. Emphasize that focus management is essential for keyboard, screen reader, and voice recognition software users to interact with non-standard widgets.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Add focus to an element that is not focusable by default using the `tabindex="0"` attribute.
* Remove focus from an element that is not focusable by default using `tabindex="-1"` attribute.
* Add focus indicators using CSS styles attached to the focused state.
* Add event listeners to a component that is not focusable by default to allow for keyboard interaction.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Explain use of the `tabindex` attribute to indicate if an element can or cannot be focusable. Explain use of the value `-1` to mark an element so that it can be focusable when it becomes visible  or available via scripts. Explain use of the value `0` to make an element focusable and put it in the relative order of the navigation according to the DOM structure. For reference on how to use the `tabindex` attribute, see the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, [Managing focus within components using a roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_roving_tabindex).
* Demonstrate use of focus indicators for users to keep track of where they are as they are interacting with the widget. For reference on how to make navigation predictable within widgets, see the WAI-ARIA authoring practices, [Discernible and predictable keyboard focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_focus_discernable_predictable).
* Demonstrate use of event listeners that allow for several ways of interaction. For example, keyboard, mouse, and tactile gestures. Emphasize that, in addition to making an element focusable, it is also necessary to take care of all additional functionality, such as which keys need to be pressed to activate it. For a pointer on what additional functionality needs to be added to a custom widget to allow keyboard functionality, see [A role is a promise](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#a_role_is_a_promise).

### Topic: Additional States

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Describe additional states of an object such as `selected`, `pressed`, `draggable`, etc. Explain how to make them distinguishable from the `focused` state.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Communicate the expanded or collapsed state using the `aria-expanded` attribute.
* Communicate the checked state of an object using the `aria-checked` attribute.
* Communicate the selected state using styles and the `aria-selected` attribute.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

 Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Demonstrate use of the `aria-expanded` attribute to convey if associated sections of an element are visible or hidden. Mention examples of widgets where this element can be used, such as menus or accordions. For reference on how to use the `aria-expanded` attribute, see the WAI-ARIA authoring practices, [Accordion (sections with show/hide functionality)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#accordion).
* Show examples of non-standard checkboxes. Mention the use of `aria-checked` to communicate the state of the checkbox. For reference on how to use the `aria-checked` attribute, see the WAI-ARIA authoring practices, [Checkbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#checkbox).
* Demonstrate differences between `focused` and `selected` states, such as in listboxes or menus. Indicate that a clear distinction should be made between these two  states, such as applying different styles for each and using the `aria-selected` attribute to convey the state of the selection. For reference on how to communicate the selected state of an object, see the WAI-ARIA authoring practices, [Listbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#Listbox).

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Dynamic Changes

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain mechanisms to notify screen reader users about dynamic changes on a page.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Code the regions of the page that contain the dynamic changes with the `role="alert"` or the attribute `aria-live`.
* Mark up the level of priority for the updates using the values `polite`, `assertive`, or `off` in the `aria-live`.
* Mark up the region to be announced as a whole or only parts using the `aria-atomic` attribute.
* Mark up additions, removals, or all changes in the node to be announced using the `aria-relevant`  attribute.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to achieve the learning outcomes.

* Invite students to navigate dynamic regions of a web page, such as carousels, chat logs, or feeds. Explain that screen reader users cannot perceive these types of updates by default as they can only be focused at one thing at a time.
* Explain use of the `role="alert"` to mark up a region as dynamic. Show examples of messages that can be included in those regions, such as information about new loaded contents on a page, or about the item that is currently visible within a set of slides.
* Demonstrate use of the `aria-live` attribute together with its values to indicate the priority with which updates are announced. For reference on the meaning of the different values of the `aria-live` attribute, see the WAI-ARIA specification, [`aria-atomic`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-atomic).
* Explain use of the `aria-relevant` attribute to communicate which changes of the node should be announced: additions, removals, or all. For reference on how to use the `aria-relevant` attribute, see the WAI-ARIA specification, [`aria-relevant`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-relevant).
