### Topic: Patterns for Navigation

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce some navigational tools such as primary and secondary menus, site maps, and breadcrumb trails. Explain why users benefit from these structures and some strategies to make them accessible.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe the purpose of a navigation menu.
* Distinguish between different types of navigation menus, such as primary or secondary.
* Identify other navigational elements such as toolbars, site maps, and breadcrumb trails.
* Use the appropriate elements, roles and properties to convey the different parts of a navigational element.

### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Introduce the concept of navigation menu. Emphasize that there might be one or several of them in a website, and that each of them should be distinguishable.
* Explain that main navigation menus help users move between the first levels of the structure of the website.
* Explain that secondary navigation elements help users move between different sub pages of a given category or section.
* Introduce the roles of nav, list, and listitem. Give examples of their usage and map them to the corresponding native HTML elements carrying these roles.
* Explain that some users take advantage of these elements to gain an understanding of which menu they are in, as well as of the name and number of elements in it.
* Emphasize that all menu items must be labeled with a meaningful text that allows to identify them.

 #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practice &mdash; Students create an accessible primary navigation menu. Assess students' capacity to use roles for navigation, lists, and lists items appropriately.
