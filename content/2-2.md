## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Single-Level Menus

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain the purpose and use of HTML elements to identify, group, and label navigational mechanisms such as menus.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Mark up navigational sections using headings and/or the `nav` HTML element.
* Group items of the same navigational mechanism using the HTML elements `ul`, `ol`, and `li`.
* Label navigational items in a web page using link text and/or the elements `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Show examples of the HTML5 `nav` element to mark up a region as navigational. For reference on how to use this element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Identify menus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/#identify-menus).
* Refer back to the HTML `ul`, `ol`, and `li` elements taught in the previous module. Explain that they serve to structure and organize lists and list items. Emphasize that screen reader users can quickly navigate between lists and list items by using specific keystrokes. For examples on how to use these elements within a menu structure, see WAI website tutorials [Menu representation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/#menu-representation).
* Provide examples of labels for navigational items. Mention that these labels can be either text or graphics with their corresponding alternative texts. Emphasize that users with cognitive disabilities and screen reader users rely on them to identify the purpose of each of the navigational items. Explain that this is a WCAG requirement under success criterion [2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#headings-and-labels).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practical &mdash; Students identify the layers of the page that contain the navigational mechanisms and mark them up. Assess students' use of the `nav` element to mark up navigational regions.
* Practical &mdash; Students check the internal structure of each of the navigational items in a website. Assess how students use list and list items to programmatically convey the structure within a navigational mechanism.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a main menu that does not contain clear labels and are asked to label its items. Assess how students describe the topic and purpose of the navigational item using headings, text, or the attributes `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Multi-Level Menus

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain use of HTML elements and WAI-ARIA attributes to indicate the presence of submenu items, for example, the `aria-haspopup` attribute. Explain how to convey visible or hidden states of menu and submenu items using WAI ARIA or text to make them operable by all users.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Convey the hierarchical relationship between a menu item and its submenus using nested lists and list items.
* Mark up items that contain submenus using the `aria-haspopup` attribute.
* Convey visible or hidden states of menu items using the `aria-expanded` attribute.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Show examples of menus that contain submenu items. Explain that the layer with the submenu items needs to be coded as a nested list, and that each of the submenu items need to be coded as a list item.
* Explain that the `aria-haspopup` attribute denotes the presence of submenu items. Indicate that this attribute should be present in the original HTML markup. Emphasize that a value of `true` means the item contains submenu items, and a value of `false` indicates that the item does not contain submenu items. For reference on how to use the `aria-haspopup` attribute, see the WAI website tutorials, [Indicate submenus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#indicate-submenus).
* Explain that the `aria-expanded` attribute conveys if the submenu items are visible or hidden. Explain that the attribute needs to be present in the original HTML markup. Emphasize that its value needs to be updated via scripts: `true` means that the elements are visible, and `false` means that the elements are hidden. For reference on how to use the `aria-expanded` attribute, see the WAI website tutorials, [Indicate submenus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#indicate-submenus).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a visual structure of menu and submenu items and are asked to use the appropriate markup to convey that structure. Assess how students use nested list and list items to programmatically convey the visual structure of complex menus.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a list of menu and submenu items and are asked to use the `aria-haspopup` attribute where necessary. Assess how students convey the presence of submenu items programmatically.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a list of menu and submenu items that dynamically show or hide based on user input and are asked to communicate these dynamic changes to assistive technologies. Assess how students use the `aria-expanded` attribute in the markup and how they update its value via scripts.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Additional Information for Menus

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain use of HTML elements to indicate where users are in a navigational mechanism, as well as ensure navigation without keyboard traps.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Ensure a consistent focus order.
* Mark up the current item within a menu using invisible text or the `aria-current="page"` attribute.
* Code navigational mechanisms so that the keyboard can be used to enter and exit them.

#### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Provide examples of different ways to indicate the current page within a menu. For example, using invisible text or the `aria-current="page"` attribute. For reference on how to indicate the current item within a menu, see the WAI website tutorials, [Indicate the Current Item](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/#indicate-the-current-item).
* Show examples of how a navigational mechanism can be entered and exited using only the keyboard. Relate this requirement to WCAG success criterion [2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?#no-keyboard-trap).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a navigational mechanism and are asked to indicate where users are. Assess how students provide clear focus indicators and markup that shows the current item in a menu.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a navigational mechanism that cannot be dismissed using the keyboard and are asked to fix it. Assess how students provide consistent keyboard navigation through the navigational mechanism.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practical &mdash; Students are asked to use an assistive technology to get to a specific web page of a website using at least two different mechanisms. Assess students' knowledge of the different ways to navigate within a site.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students add a set of web pages to the website they are building. Then they provide navigational mechanisms so that users can go to the different web pages and can find content. Assess how students implement, identify, organize, and label navigational mechanisms.

## Teaching Resources
