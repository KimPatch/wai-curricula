## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Patterns for Navigation

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce some strategies to navigate web pages. For example, demonstrate how a menu can be navigated using the keyboard only, an assistive technology, or an adaptive strategy.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe the following user strategies to browse web content:
  * Use of the tab, arrow, enter, or escape keys.
  * Voice commands to go to previous or next focusable element.
  * Switch controls that emulate keyboard presses.
* Provide visual cues via the CSS `:focus` selector.
* Allow for a consistent focus order, both visually and programmatically.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Use the tab and shift + tab keys to move between different links of a menu. Demonstrate how the Enter or Space keys can be used to open a submenu, and the Escape key can be use to close it. Explain that these are WCAG requirements under success criterion [2.4.1 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#keyboard).
* Show examples of web pages where focus matches visual presentation. Underline that keeping focus order is needed for consistency between the visual and programmatic order of items in a menu. Link this requirement to WCAG success criterion [2.4.3 Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#focus-order).
* Show examples of default and custom visual focus indicators. Explain that these indicators can help users know where they are as they browse the web page. Mention that it is sometimes best practice to provide custom indicators for better visibility and contrast ratios. Link this requirement to WCAG success criterion [2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#focus-visible).
* Demonstrate use of commands built-in to speech recognition software to browse the Web such as "Go to next link" or "open favorites". Explain that these only work if menu items are semantically meaningful.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a website with several navigation menus and identify its main menu. Assess how students point to different menus of the website and explain their function and purpose.
* Practical &mdash; Students build the site map of a website. Assess how students understand the underlying structure of a website and the hierarchical relationship between its pages.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a main menu which is visually apparent but lacks semantic structure. Assess how students include semantic information in menus.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Structuring and Labeling Menus

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce HTML elements that convey the structure of menus. Present strategies that allow for a consistent identification and labeling of menus, breadcrumb trails, and site maps.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe main types of navigational mechanisms:
  * Primary menus.
  * Secondary menus.
  * breadcrumb trails.
  * Site maps.
  * toolbars.
* Markup navigational sections with  headings and/or the `nav` element.
* Group items in a menu with the `ul`, `ol`, and `li` HTML tag.
* Provide adequate labels for each of the menus in a web page by means of a heading element, link text, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby` elements.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Introduce the concept of main and secondary navigation menus. Mention that main navigation menus help users move between the first levels of the structure of the website. Explain that secondary navigation menus help users move between different subpages of a given category or section. Emphasize that there should be only one main menu, but there might be several secondary menus in a web page. Emphasize that when there is more than one navigational mechanism  in a page, it is good practice to label each of them with a distinctive name by using headings, the `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby` attributes. Explain that this is a WCAG requirement under success criterion [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#name-role-value).
* Define site maps as Web pages that provide links to different sections of the site. Explain that they can be ordered alphabetically, by topic, or by category within the website's structure. For reference on how to provide a site map, see technique [G63: Providing a site map](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G63).
* Define breadcrumb trails as a way for users to keep track of the hierarchical structure of a particular web page within a set of web pages. Present examples of its structure and common patterns to include them. For reference on how to provide breadcrumb trails, see technique [G65: Providing a breadcrumb trail](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G65).
* Introduce the HTML5 `nav` element. Explain that it serves to markup a region as navigational. For reference on how to use this element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Identify menus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/#identify-menus)
* Introduce the HTML `ul`, `ol`, and `li` elements. Explain that they serve to structure and organize lists and list items. Emphasize that screen reader users can quickly navigate between lists and list items by using specific keystrokes. Explain that this is a WCAG requirement under success criterion [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#name-role-value). For examples on how to use these elements within a menu structure, see WAI website tutorials [Menu Representation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/#menu-representation).
* Emphasize that all menu items must be labeled with a meaningful text that allows users to identify them. Mention that these labels can be either text or graphics with their corresponding alternative texts. Emphasize that users with cognitive disabilities and screen reader users use them to identify the purpose of each of the menu items. Explain that this is a WCAG requirement under success criterion [2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#headings-and-labels).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment. 

* Practical &mdash; Students identify the layers within the page containing the navigational mechanisms and mark them appropriately. Assess students' use of the `nav` elements and the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes to provide distinctive labels.
* Practical &mdash; Students check the internal structure of each of the menu items in a website. Assess how students use the roles `list` and `listtitem` to programmatically convey the structure of menus.
* Practical &mdash; Students disable images and CSS to navigate a given menu. Assess how students identify missing information and provide it using clear text or text alternatives.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Additional Functionality
 
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain how to convey the state of submenu items and how to make them operable by all users.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Markup the hierarchical relationship between a menu item and its submenus with nested lists and list items.
* Provide multiple ways to access a web page within a set of web pages:
  * Links in the menu structure.
  * Links in the first-level page.
  * Search function.
* Markup a submenu with the `aria-haspopup` attribute.
* Markup expanded or collapsed states of menu items with the `aria-expanded` attribute.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Introduce the concept of nesting lists to denote the presence of submenu items.
* Explain that sometimes it is hard for users with motor disabilities or screen reader users to access links of submenu items. Emphasize that these submenu links can also be provided in first level pages so that all users can access them in several ways.
* Introduce the `aria-haspopup` attribute. Explain that it serves to denote the presence of submenu items. Indicate that this attribute should be present in the original HTML markup. Emphasize that a value of `true` means the item contains submenu items, and a value of `false` indicates that the item does not contain submenu items. For reference on how to use this attribute, see the WAI website tutorials, [Indicate submenus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#indicate-submenus).
* Introduce the `aria-expanded` attribute. Indicate that it is placed in the menu item containing the submenu, and that it serves to convey if the submenu items are visible or hidden. Explain that the attribute needs to be present in the original HTML markup. Emphasize that its value needs to be updated via scripts: `true` means that the elements are visible, and `false` means that the elements are hidden. For reference on how to use this attribute, see the WAI website tutorials, [Indicate submenus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#indicate-submenus).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a visual structure of menu and submenu items and are asked to use the appropriate markup to convey that structure. Assess how students use nested list and list items to programmatically convey the visual structure.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a list of menu and submenu items and are asked to use the `aria-haspopup` attribute where necessary. Assess how students use the `aria-haspopup` attribute in the HTML markup.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a list of menu and submenu items that dynamically show or hide based on user input and are asked to communicate these dynamic changes to assistive technologies. Assess how students use the `aria-expanded` attribute in the markup and how they update its value via scripts.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* [Idea] Practice &mdash; Students create an accessible primary navigation menu. Assess how students use roles for navigation, lists, and list items appropriately.

## Teaching Resources

Suggested resources to support your teaching:

* [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/people-use-web/) &mdash; Provides stories of people with disabilities using the Web; describes types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* [Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)](/perspective-videos/) &mdash; Is a series of 1-minute videos that demonstrate that web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. They show accessibility features, how they impact people with disabilities, and how they benefit everyone in a variety of situations.
* [WAI Web Accessibility Tutorials (Menus)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/) -- Provides guidance about making navigation components accessible.
* WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [ARIA can both cloak and enhance](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices#principle-2-aria-can-both-cloak-and-enhance-creating-both-power-and-danger) section &mdash; provides readers with an understanding of how to use WAI-ARIA to create accessible rich internet applications.
* [HTML5 contents for grouping elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#grouping-content/) -- Presents elements that serve to group content.
* [WCAG Success Criterion 2.4.1 Keyboard] &mdash; All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.
* [WCAG Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order]() &mdash; If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.
* [WCAG Success Criterion 2.4.7 Focus Visible]() &mdash; Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.
* [WCAG Success Criteria 2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#headings-and-labels) &mdash; Headings and labels describe topic or purpose.
* [WCAG Success Criteria 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#name-role-value) &mdash; For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.
