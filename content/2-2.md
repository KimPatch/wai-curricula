## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Patterns for Navigation

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce some navigation components such as primary and secondary menus, site maps, and breadcrumb trails. Explain why users rely on these structures. Mention some strategies to make them accessible.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Distinguish between different types of navigation menus, such as primary or secondary.
* Identify other navigational elements such as toolbars, site maps, and breadcrumb trails.
* Distinguish the appropriate elements, roles, and properties to convey the different parts of a navigational element.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Introduce the concept of main and secondary navigation menu. Mention that main navigation menus help users move between the first levels of the structure of the website. Explain that secondary navigation menus help users move between different subpages of a given category or section. Emphasize that there should be only one main menu, but there might be several secondary menus in a website. Underline that each of them should be distinguishable.
* Introduce the roles of `nav`, `list`, and `listitem`. Relate them to the corresponding native HTML elements carrying these roles. Give examples of their usage and introduce some WAI-ARIA properties that can be applied to non-standard HTML elements to explicitly convey these roles.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a website with several navigation menus and identify its main menu. Assess how students point to different menus of the website and explain their function and purpose.
* Practice &mdash; Students build the site map of a website. Assess how students understand the underlying structure of a website and the hierarchical relationship between its pages.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a main menu which is visually apparent but lacks semantic structure. Assess how students include semantic information in menus.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Structuring and Labeling Navigational Elements

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce HTML elements that convey the structure of menus. Present strategies that allow for a consistent identification and labeling of menus, breadcrumb trails, and site maps.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Markup navigational sections with the `nav` element or a heading.
* Group items in a menu with `ul` HTML tag.
* Provide adequate labels for each of the menus in a web page by means of a heading element, link text, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby` elements.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Explain that screen reader users take advantage of the nav element to distinguish the menus from other components. Emphasize that when there is more than one `nav` element in a page, it is good practice to label each of them with a distinctive name by using headings, the `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby` attributes.
* Mention that the roles `list` and `listitem` help users understand how many items the menu contains. Emphasize that screen reader users can quickly navigate between lists and list items by using specific keystrokes.
* Emphasize that all menu items must be labeled with a meaningful text that allows users to identify them. Mention that these labels can be either text or graphics with their corresponding alternative texts. Emphasize that users with cognitive disabilities and screen reader users use them to identify the purpose of each of the menu items.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment. 

* Practice &mdash; Students identify the layers within the page containing the navigational elements and mark them appropriately. Assess students' use of the `nav` elements and the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes to provide distinctive labels.
* Practice &mdash; Students check the internal structure of each of the menu items in a website. Assess how students use the roles `list` and `listtitem` to convey the structure of menus programmatically.
* Practice &mdash; Students disable images and CSS to navigate a given menu. Assess how students identify missing information and provide it using clear text or text alternatives.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Additional Functionality

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain some aspects that help make components such as submenus and dropdown menus accessible.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Markup the hierarchical relationship between a menu item and its submenus with nested lists and list items.
* Provide several ways to access submenu items, such as links in the menu structure or in the first-level page.
* Markup a submenu with the `aria-haspopup` attribute.
* Markup expanded or collapsed states of menu items with the `aria-expanded` attribute.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Introduce the concept of nesting lists to denote the presence of submenu items.
* Explain that sometimes it is hard for screen reader  users or users with motor disabilities to access links of submenu items. Emphasize that these submenu links can also be provided in first level pages so that all users can access them in several ways.
* Introduce the `aria-haspopup` attribute of a menu item to denote the presence of submenu items. Indicate that this attribute should be present in the original HTML markup.
* Introduce the `aria-expanded` attribute. Indicate that it is placed in the menu item containing the submenu, and that it serves to convey if the submenu items are visible or hidden. Explain that the attribute needs to be present in the original HTML markup. Emphasize that its value needs to be updated via scripts: `true` means that the elements are visible, and `false` means that the elements are hidden.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a visual structure of menu and submenu items and are asked to use the appropriate markup to convey that structure. Assess how students use nested list and list items to programmatically convey the visual structure.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a list of menu and submenu items and are asked to use the `aria-haspopup` attribute where necessary. Assess how students use the `aria-haspopup` attribute in the HTML markup.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a list of menu and submenu items that dynamically show or hide based on user input and are asked to communicate these dynamic changes to assistive technologies. Assess how students use the `aria-expanded` attribute in the markup and how they update its value via scripts.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* [Idea] Practice &mdash; Students create an accessible primary navigation menu. Assess how students use roles for navigation, lists, and list items appropriately.

## Teaching Resources

Suggested resources to support your teaching:

* [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/people-use-web/) &mdash; Provides stories of people with disabilities using the Web; describes types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* [Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)](/perspective-videos/) &mdash; Is a series of 1-minute videos that demonstrate that web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all.
