## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Finding Pages and Content

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain strategies that people use to navigate across web pages. For example, menus, search functions, site maps, and breadcrumb trails. Indicate that these are requirements under success criterion [2.4.5 Multiple Ways](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#multiple-ways).

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe how users navigate across web pages and find content using:
  * Search functions.
  * Primary menus.
  * Secondary menus.
  * Breadcrumb trails.
  * Site maps.
* Provide mechanisms to bypass blocks of content.
* Ensure a consistent focus order.
* Provide visual cues using the CSS `:focus` selector.
 
#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* of content. the `aria-haspopup` attribute can be used to help keyboard-only users and users with motor disabilities to jump to the specific content of a web page, or to skip large blocks of navigation. Link this requirement to WCAG success criterion [2.4.1 Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#bypass-blocks).
* Invite students to use search functions. Explain that they allow users to find content by typing words that are part of the website. Explain that they can be included using either a form field with a button to trigger the search, or a link that takes to the search form. For examples of search functions, see technique [G161: Providing a search function to help users find content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G161.html).
* and secondary the `aria-haspopup` attribute that main navigation menus help users move between the first-level pages of the website. Explain that secondary navigation menus help users move between different subpages of a given category or section. Emphasize that there should be only one main menu, but there might be several secondary menus in a web page. For reference on how to code menus in an accessible way, see the WAI website tutorials, [Menus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/).
* Define site maps as web pages that provide links to different sections of the site. Explain that they can be ordered alphabetically, by topic, or by category. For reference on how to provide a site map, see technique [G63: Providing a site map](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G63).
* Define breadcrumb trails as a way for users to keep track of the hierarchical structure of a particular web page within a set of web pages. Present examples of its structure and common patterns to include them. For reference on how to provide breadcrumb trails, see technique [G65: Providing a breadcrumb trail](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G65).
* Underline that keeping focus order is needed for consistency between the visual and programmatic order of items. Show examples of web pages where source order matches visual presentation and compare them with pages where it does not. Link this requirement to WCAG success criterion [2.4.3 Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#focus-order).
* Show examples of default and custom visual focus indicators. Explain that these indicators can help users know where they are as they browse the web page. Mention that it is sometimes best practice to provide custom indicators for better visibility and contrast ratios. Link this requirement to WCAG success criterion [2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#focus-visible).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short answer questions &mdash; Students are asked how many different navigational mechanisms they are aware of and are asked to explain its main features. Assess students' knowledge of how people navigate across web pages and find specific content.
* Practical &mdash: Students build a mechanism to bypass blocks of content. Assess students' understanding of the difference between repeated and specific content of a web page within a set of web pages.
* Practical &mdash; Students build the site map of a given website. Assess students' understanding of the underlying structure of a website and the hierarchical relationship between its pages.
* Practical &mdash; Students provide the breadcrumb trail for a specific web page within a site. Assess how students' express the particular location of a web page within a set of web pages.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Labeling Navigational Mechanisms

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Discuss how to identify, group, and label navigational mechanisms.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Mark up navigational sections using headings and/or the `nav` element.
* Group items of the same navigational mechanism using the `ul`, `ol`, and `li` HTML tag.
* label navigational mechanisms in a web page by means of a heading element, link text, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby` elements.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Show examples of the HTML5 `nav` element to mark up a region as navigational. For reference on how to use this element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Identify menus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/#identify-menus).
* Refer back to the HTML `ul`, `ol`, and `li` elements taught in previous module. Explain that they serve to structure and organize lists and list items. Emphasize that screen reader users can quickly navigate between lists and list items by using specific keystrokes. For examples on how to use these elements within a menu structure, see WAI website tutorials [Menu representation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/#menu-representation).
* Discuss with students possible ways of labelling navigational items. Mention that these labels can be either text or graphics with their corresponding alternative texts. Emphasize that users with cognitive disabilities and screen reader users rely on them to identify the purpose of each of the navigational items. Explain that this is a WCAG requirement under success criterion [2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#headings-and-labels).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practical &mdash; Students identify the layers of the page that contain the navigational mechanisms and mark them up. Assess students' use of the `nav` element to mark up navigational regions.
* Practical &mdash; Students check the internal structure of each of the navigational items in a website. Assess how students use list and list items to programmatically convey the structure within a navigational mechanism.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a main menu that does not contain clear labels and are asked to label its items. Assess how students describe the topic and purpose of the navigation item using headings, text, or the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` items.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Menus and Submenus

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Apply mechanisms to indicate the presence of submenu items, for example, the `aria-haspopup` attribute. Explain how to convey visible or hidden states of menu and submenu items using WAI ARIA or text to make them operable by all users.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Convey the hierarchical relationship between a menu item and its submenus using nested lists and list items.
* Mark up the current item within a menu using invisible text or the `aria-current="page"` attribute.
* Mark up items that contain submenus using the `aria-haspopup` attribute.
* Convey visible or hidden states of menu items using the `aria-expanded` attribute.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Show examples of menus that contain submenu items. Explain that the layer with the submenu items needs to be coded as a nested list, and that each of the submenu items need to be coded as a list item.
* Discuss with students different ways to indicate the current page within a menu. For example, using invisible text or the `aria-current="page"` attribute. For reference on how to indicate the current item within a menu, see the WAI website tutorials, [Indicate the Current Item](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/#indicate-the-current-item).
* Explain that the `aria-haspopup` attribute denotes the presence of submenu items. Indicate that this attribute should be present in the original HTML markup. Emphasize that a value of `true` means the item contains submenu items, and a value of `false` indicates that the item does not contain submenu items. For reference on how to use the `aria-haspopup` attribute, see the WAI website tutorials, [Indicate submenus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#indicate-submenus).
* Explain that the `aria-expanded` attribute conveys if the submenu items are visible or hidden. Explain that the attribute needs to be present in the original HTML markup. Emphasize that its value needs to be updated via scripts: `true` means that the elements are visible, and `false` means that the elements are hidden. For reference on how to use the `aria-expanded` attribute, see the WAI website tutorials, [Indicate submenus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#indicate-submenus).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a visual structure of menu and submenu items and are asked to use the appropriate markup to convey that structure. Assess how students use nested list and list items to programmatically convey the visual structure of complex menus.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a list of menu and submenu items and are asked to use the `aria-haspopup` attribute where necessary. Assess how students convey the presence of submenu items programmatically.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a list of menu and submenu items that dynamically show or hide based on user input and are asked to communicate these dynamic changes to assistive technologies. Assess how students use the `aria-expanded` attribute in the markup and how they update its value via scripts.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practical &mdash; Students are asked to use an assistive technology to get to a specific web page of a website using at least two different mechanisms. Assess students' knowledge of the different ways to navigate within a set of web pages.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students add a set of web pages to the website they are building. Then they provide navigational mechanisms so that users can go to the different web pages and can find content. Assess how students implement, identify, organize, and label navigational mechanisms.

## Teaching Resources

Suggested resources to support your teaching:

* [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/people-use-web/) &mdash; Provides stories of people with disabilities using the Web; describes types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* [Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)](/perspective-videos/) &mdash; Is a series of 1-minute videos that demonstrate that web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. They show accessibility features, how they impact people with disabilities, and how they benefit everyone in a variety of situations.
