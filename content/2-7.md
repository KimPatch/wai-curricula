## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module:

* explain the use of accessible coding to create applications rendered using JavaScript, such as single page applications
* demonstrate how structure and relationships, navigational mechanisms, keyboard and focus interactions, and notifications enable people with disabilities to interact with rich applications

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain the accessibility implications of dynamically generated content as opposed to page reloads
* explain how structure and relationships, navigational mechanisms, keyboard and focus interactions, and updates enable people with disabilities to operate rich applications
* code structure and relationships for rich application components that are perceived by people with disabilities
* mark up states of application components, such as displayed or hidden, so that they are communicated to assistive technologies
* code the necessary reading order to navigate between application components using multiple input devices
* summarize related requirements for designers to customize notifications that allow people with disabilities to check them at their pace 
* summarize related requirements for designers to allow switching updates or notifications on or off to avoid conflicts with assistive technologies reading several notifications at the same time

## Topics to Teach

Topics to support the teaching sequence:

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Structure and Relationships

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate the use of markup and coding techniques to communicate the overall application structure and the relationships between application components. Discuss elements that are common to all application views, such as title or main heading. 

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code updates for application structural elements such as titles, headings, and regions as view changes occur
* code relationships between different application components, such as navigational mechanisms, text areas, or other functional components, using distinctive region labels

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: State Changes

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Provide examples of different component states within an application such as displayed, or hidden. Discuss different ways to code those states accessibly.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code waiting time warnings such as when a view is loading or data needs to be processed using live regions 
* mark up the `hidden` state of application components using `aria-hidden`
* mark up the `displayed` state of application components removing `aria-hidden` when they become visible

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Keyboard and Focus Interaction

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate the use of coding techniques to make all necessary elements of the interface focusable, such as use of natively focusable HTML elements or the attribute `tabindex`. Mention common keyboard operations, such as changing views or selecting specific components.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code focusable elements of a given view using natively focusable HTML elements or `tabindex="0"
* code application components that are not focusable at a given stage using `tabindex="-1"
* explain how keyboard operations such as using the tab key or using dedicated keystrokes enable people with disabilities to move between different application components
* code document object model (DOM) order that matches the reading order of the applications

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

#### Topic: Updates and Notifications

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate the use of live regions to communicate updates and notifications based on user interaction.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code status messages that announce the newly selected view after a view change using assertive live regions
* code user notifications based on user interaction, such as warnings about possible data loss
* code updates from application components, such as when a new message has arrived using polite live regions
