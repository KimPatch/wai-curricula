## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module:

* explain the use of proper coding to create applications rendered using JavaScript frameworks, such as single page applications
* demonstrate how people with disabilities use structure and relationships, navigational mechanisms, keyboard and focus interactions, and notifications to interact with rich  applications

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* distinguish between page reloads and application view changes generated with scripts
* identify use cases for rich applications
* explain how structure and relationships, navigational mechanisms, keyboard and focus interactions, and notifications enable people with disabilities to operate rich applications
* code structure and relationships for rich application components
* code the necessary keyboard interactions to navigate between application components
* code notifications and updates for applications so that they are perceived by assistive technologies
* mark up states of application components, such as displayed or hidden
