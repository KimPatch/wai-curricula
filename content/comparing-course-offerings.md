## Introduction

This page provides further guidance on how to compare and select course offerings using the materials of the WAI-Curricula. It underlines key points that might be taken into account when analyzing course offerings to select the ones that best suit your needs.

## Comparing Course Offerings

* Learning Outcomes -- First, ask for mappings that demonstrate how the course addresses learning outcomes in the curricula. The course does not need to follow the learning outcomes as they are outlined in the curricula modules, but it is advisable that at least those at a unit level are properly covered.
* Teaching Ideas -- Focus on how the course offeror plans to teach the learning outcomes. Ask for demonstrations of the teaching abilities of the instructors or the materials used for the course if it is a MOOC.
* Ideas to Assess Knowledge -- Focus on how the provider plans to assess knowledge. Ask for specific activities and their expected outcomes.
* Course accreditation -- Ask if the provider offers credentials on course completion, such as certificates or free choice subject credits.
* Availability of materials -- Ask the provider how they will make materials available to you and if they are going to let you keep the slides and/or handouts.
* Specific audience needs -- Make sure the course offeror will cover requirements from all your participants: accessibility needs, cultural preferences.
