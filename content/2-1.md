## Topics to Teach

 Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Page Regions

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain how people with disabilities use page regions, such as header, footer, navigation, and main, to navigate. Provide hands-on training for common markup used to identify such page regions.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe strategies to interact with and move to different regions of a web page by using:
  * Browser extensions and screen reader keystrokes to go to next or previous region.
  * Screen readers functionality that presents an isolated list or tree with all regions of the page.
  * Browser reading functionality that focuses on the main contents of the page.
* Code regions of a page using `header`, `nav`, `main`, and `footer`, elements, and their corresponding ARIA landmarks.
* Label regions using headings, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Invite students to explore screen readers to get to different regions of a web page. Introduce specific keystrokes used to get to each type of region. Demonstrate advanced functionality that presents all the regions of a web page in a tree list out of context. Mention that these structural components help users orient and navigate web pages. For reference on how screen reader users interact and navigate web pages, see [Stories of Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/).
* Invite students to try out functionality built-in to some browsers to enhance reading. Explain that it changes the layout of the page, showing the main content of a web page when it is marked up appropriately. Discuss with students how this can improve readability for all users. Refer to the support pages of browsers for more information on the particular reading modes they provide.
* Show examples of browser extensions that allow users to move between regions of a web page using keyboard shortcuts. Explain that these help keyboard-only users to move through the different regions of a website when they are marked up appropriately.
* Show examples of different page layouts, and their mark up of the header, navigation, main content, and footer regions. Discuss the general preference to use native HTML5 elements to the extent possible, and ARIA attributes where needed. For guidance on how to use HTML5 sections, see the WAI website tutorials, [Regions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/).
* Explain that ARIA landmarks provide broader support for old assistive technologies and browsers. Emphasize that they can also enhance HTML 4 semantics if applied to an ordinary `div` element. For uses of ARIA landmarks associated to their corresponding HTML5 elements, see the WAI website tutorials [Page Regions in HTML5 Using WAI ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#accessupport).

**Note:** Assistive technologies are sometimes not easy to use. Give clear instructions to students about the specific steps to follow. When possible, follow students through their interactions with assistive technologies to avoid misunderstandings of the technologies.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to assess knowledge.

* Research &mdash; Students research the documentation of their screen reader of choice and find keystrokes to navigate regions, as well as mechanisms to reveal the list of regions in a page. Assess studentsâ€™ understanding of mechanisms for screen reader users to move through regions.
* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked about the types of regions in a web page and how each of these can be coded. Assess students' knowledge of the different regions of the page and how to code them.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with several pieces of content and are asked to mark them up with HTML sections elements. Assess students' knowledge of the different types of regions of a web page, and the different HTML and ARIA techniques to mark up these regions.
* Practical &mdash; Students are asked to determine the regions of a web page using plugins or browser extensions. Assess how students use plugins for evaluating web accessibility.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Headings

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate application of the HTML elements `h1` through `h6` to label page sections and passages of content. Explain that headings are used by some assistive technology users to orient and navigate.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe how people with disabilities interact with headings using:
  * Browser extensions and screen reader keystrokes to go to next or previous heading.
  * Screen readers functionality that presents an isolated list of all headings in the web page.
* Code headings using the HTML elements `h1` through `h6`, or the ARIA attributes `role="heading"` and `aria-level=1` through `aria-level=6`.
* Rank headings according to the hierarchical structure of the content.
* Provide heading text that describes the passages entitled by the heading.

#### teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Invite students to explore screen readers to go to next or previous heading. Show advanced functionality that allows to present all headings in a list where users can select the one they want to get to. For reference on how screen reader users interact and navigate web pages, see [Stories of Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#accountant).
* Explain that headings are organized in a hierarchical structure, i.e., h1 being the first rank and h6 being the last one. Discuss the general preference to use native HTML elements to the extent possible, and ARIA attributes where needed. Show examples of how headings can be nested to entitle different sections and subsections of content. For several examples on how to structure pages using headings, see the WAI website tutorials, section [Headings that Reflect the Page Organization](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/#headings-that-reflect-the-page-organization).
* Present examples of texts that are included in headings and reflect with students if they are descriptive of the sections they entitle. For reference on how to use headings to organize passages of text, see the WAI website tutorials, section [Organize Passages of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/#organize-passages-of-text).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to assess knowledge.

* Research &mdash; Students research the documentation of their screen reader of choice and find keystrokes to navigate headings, as well as mechanisms to reveal the list of all the headings in a page. Assess students' understanding of mechanisms for screen reader users to move through headings.
* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked how many heading levels there are, and how each of the heading levels can be coded. Assess students' knowledge of the `h1` through `h6` elements, as well as the corresponding ARIA attributes.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a web page that contains incorrect heading ranks and are asked to use `h1` through `h6` elements to indicate the correct heading structure. Assess how students relate the visual layout of the page with the underlying structure.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with headings that do not describe the sections they entitle and are asked to replace the heading's text with descriptive information. Assess how students provide descriptive titles for sections.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Page Contents

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain the use of HTML elements to convey the structure of contents in a web page. For example, sections, paragraphs, lists, and tables.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Mark up sections of content with the `section` or `article` elements.
* Mark up paragraphs with the `p` element.
* Mark up lists of items with `ul`, `ol`, or `dl` elements.
* Ensure content follows a meaningful sequence.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Define the `section` element as a thematic grouping of content. For an example of how to code the `section` element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Sections](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#sections).
* Define the `article` element as a self-containing unit within the web page. For an example of how to use the `article` element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Articles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#articles).
* Explain that the `p` element is used to mark up paragraphs of text. Explain that it improves readability for all users. For an example of how to code the `paragraph` element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Paragraphs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#paragraphs).
* Explain that unordered lists are used to group items where the numbering is not relevant, and ordered lists are used when numbering of items matters. Explain that these lists are marked up with the `ul` or `ol` element, and each of the items is coded with the `li` element. Emphasize that each of the list items can contain headings, paragraphs, or other lists. For an example of how to use unordered lists, see the WAI website tutorials, [list](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#lists).
* Define description lists as a grouping of several terms and descriptions. Definition lists are coded with the `dl` element, terms are coded with a `dt` element, and descriptions are marked up with a `dd` element. For examples of how to use description lists, see the WAI website tutorials, [Description Lists](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#description-lists).
* Show content in different layouts, for example, with different style sheets applied. Emphasize that content always needs to follow a meaningful sequence that allows to adapt the content to different ways of presentation. For information on how to ensure a meaningful sequence, see technique [G57: Ordering the content in a meaningful sequence](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G57).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to assess knowledge.

* Research &mdash; Students research the HTML specification and provide information about the different ways of coding sections of content. Assess students' knowledge of the HTML elements for marking up content.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with several types of lists and are asked to code them using their corresponding HTML list element. Assess students' knowledge of the different types of lists.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a passage of text containing several sections, paragraphs, and lists. They are asked to code the passage using the corresponding HTML elements.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Meta Information

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate the use of the `title` element to identify web pages. Explain the use of the `lang` attribute to identify the language of a web page and of other parts of the page where necessary.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Mark up and describe page titles with the `title` element.
* Apply the `lang` attribute to mark up the main language of a page.
* Apply the `lang` attribute to mark up other parts of a page using languages different than the default.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Demonstrate use of the `title` element within the `head` element to convey the topic or purpose of the page. Show examples of where and how browsers and assistive technologies show the contents of the `title` element: screen reader keystrokes, browser tabs, browser window titles, and search results. Relate this requirement to WCAG success criterion [2.4.2 Page Titled](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#page-titled). For reference on how to provide descriptive titles, see technique [G88: Providing descriptive titles for Web pages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G88.html) and [H25: Providing a title using the title element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H25). For best practices on how to write page titles, see the Easy Checks resource, section [Page title](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#title).
* Show examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies speaking content in different languages. Mention that language of page and language of parts are requirements under success criterion [3.1.1 Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#language-of-page) and [3.1.2 Language of Parts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#language-of-parts).
* Demonstrate use of the `lang` attribute to convey the main language of a web page. Explain that it is placed within the `html` tag, and that it takes a value from [BCP47: Tags for the identification of languages](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt). For reference on how to convey the main language of a web page, see technique [H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57.html).
* Emphasize that, when there is a passage of text in a different language than the default, the `lang` attribute needs to be used with a value that corresponds to the language of that passage. For an explanation of how to use the `lang` attribute to convey changes in language, see [H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H58.html).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to assess knowledge.

* Practical &mdash; Students are directed to a site and are asked to determine if page titles  are descriptive. Assess students' understanding of how to write titles for pages.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a set of web pages. Students  are asked to choose a title that best describes each of the pages and code it appropriately. Assess students' knowledge of the `title` element and how to provide descriptive content.
* Research &mdash; Students research the tags for the identification of languages and find out the language tag for three languages. Assess students' knowledge of the different  language tags available.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with several passages of text written in different languages and are asked to code them using the correct language tag. Assess students' knowledge about how to code the different language tags.
