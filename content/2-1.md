## Topics to Teach

 Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Headings

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate application of the HTML elements `h1` through `h6` to label page sections and passages of content. Explain that headings are used by some assistive technology users to orient and navigate.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe how headings allow people with disabilities to understand the structure of a page and navigate it by using:
  * Browser extensions and screen reader keystrokes to go to next or previous heading.
  * Screen readers functionality that presents an isolated list of all headings in the web page.
* Code headings using the HTML elements `h1` through `h6`.
* Rank headings according to the hierarchical structure of the content.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Invite students to navigate headings using a screen reader. Explore advanced screen reader functionality which presents all headings in a list where users can select the heading they are interested in. For reference on how screen reader users interact and navigate web pages, see [Stories of Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#accountant).
* Explain that headings are organized in a hierarchical structure, i.e., h1 being the first rank and h6 being the last one. Emphasize that native HTML elements are more likely to be supported by browsers and assistive technologies. Show examples of how headings can be nested to entitle different sections and subsections of content. For several examples on how to structure pages using headings, see the WAI website tutorials, section [Headings that Reflect the Page Organization](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/#headings-that-reflect-the-page-organization).
* Present examples of headings and reflect with students if they are descriptive of the sections they entitle. Mention that providing descriptive headings is a shared responsibility among team members: content authors, designers, and developers. For reference on how to use headings to organize passages of text, see the WAI website tutorials, section [Organize Passages of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/#organize-passages-of-text).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to assess knowledge:

* Research &mdash; Students are provided with screen reader keystrokes to navigate headings, as well as mechanisms to reveal the list of all the headings in a page. Assess students' understanding of mechanisms for screen reader users to move through headings.
* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked how many heading levels there are in the HTML specification, and how each of the heading levels can be coded. Assess students' knowledge of the `h1` through `h6` elements.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a web page that contains incorrect heading ranks and are asked to use `h1` through `h6` elements to indicate the correct heading structure. Assess how students relate the visual layout of the page with the underlying structure.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with headings that do not describe the sections they entitle and are asked to replace the heading's text with descriptive information. Assess how students provide descriptive titles for sections.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Page Contents

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain the use of HTML elements to convey the structure of contents in a web page. For example, sections, paragraphs, and lists.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Mark up sections of content with the `section` or `article` elements.
* Mark up paragraphs with the `p` element.
* Mark up lists of items with `ul`, `ol`, or `dl` elements.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Define the `section` element as a thematic grouping of content. For an example of how to code the `section` element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Sections](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#sections).
* Define the `article` element as a self-containing unit within the web page. For an example of how to code the `article` element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Articles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#articles).
* Explain that the `p` element is used to mark up paragraphs of text. Explain that it improves readability for all users. For an example of how to code the `paragraph` element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Paragraphs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#paragraphs).
* Explain that unordered lists are used to group items where the numbering is not relevant, and ordered lists are used when numbering of items matters. Explain that these lists are marked up with the `ul` or `ol` element, and each of the items is coded with the `li` element. Emphasize that each of the list items can contain headings, paragraphs, or other lists. For an example of how to code unordered lists, see the WAI website tutorials, [list](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#lists).
* Define description lists as a grouping of several terms and descriptions. Definition lists are coded with the `dl` element, terms are coded with a `dt` element, and descriptions are marked up with a `dd` element. For examples of how to code description lists, see the WAI website tutorials, [Description Lists](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#description-lists).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to assess knowledge:

* Research &mdash; Students research the HTML specification and provide information about the different ways of coding sections of content. Assess students' knowledge of the HTML elements for marking up content.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with several types of lists and are asked to code them using their corresponding HTML list element. Assess students' knowledge of the different types of lists.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a passage of text containing several sections, paragraphs, and lists. They are asked to code the passage using the corresponding HTML elements.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Page Regions

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain how page regions, such as header, footer, navigation, and main, allow people with disabilities to orient and navigate. Provide hands-on training for common markup used to identify such page regions.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe how page regions allow people with disabilities to interact with and move through a web page by using:
  * Browser extensions and screen reader keystrokes to go to next or previous region.
  * Screen readers functionality that presents an isolated list or tree with all regions of the page.
  * Browser reading functionality that focuses on the main contents of the page.
* Code regions of a page using `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, and `footer`, elements, and their corresponding ARIA landmarks.
* Label regions using headings, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Invite students to get to different regions of a web page using screen reader keystrokes to get to each type of region. Explore advanced screen reader functionality which presents regions in a list or tree where users can select the heading they are interested in. Mention that these structural components help users orient and navigate web pages. For reference on how screen reader users interact and navigate web pages, see [Stories of Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/).
* Invite students to try out functionality built-in to some browsers to enhance reading. Explain that it changes the layout of the page, showing the main content of a web page when it is marked up appropriately. Discuss with students how this can improve readability for all users. Refer to the support pages of browsers for more information on the particular reading modes they provide.
* Show examples of browser extensions that allow users to move between regions of a web page using keyboard shortcuts. Explain that these help keyboard-only users to move through the different regions of a website when they are marked up appropriately.
* Show examples of different page layouts, and their markup of the header, navigation, main content, and footer regions. Emphasize that native HTML elements are more likely to be supported by browsers and assistive technologies. For guidance on how to use HTML5 sections, see the WAI website tutorials, [Regions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/).
* Explain that ARIA landmarks provide broader support for old assistive technologies and browsers. Emphasize that they can also enhance HTML 4 semantics if applied to an ordinary `div` element. For uses of ARIA landmarks associated to their corresponding HTML5 elements, see the WAI website tutorials [Page Regions in HTML5 Using WAI ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#accessupport).
* Show examples of labels for regions included in headings, or using `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`. Explain that page regions need to be labeled to distinguish them from one another when two regions of the same type are used in a web page. For reference on how to label regions, see the WAI website tutorials, [Labeling regions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/labels/).

**Note:** Assistive technologies are sometimes not easy to use. Give clear instructions to students about the specific steps to follow. When possible, follow students through their interactions with assistive technologies to avoid misunderstandings of the technologies.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Navigation and Orientation

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain strategies to navigate across web pages. For example, page titles and language, menus, search functions, site maps, and breadcrumb trails. Indicate that these are requirements under success criterion [2.4.5 Multiple Ways](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#multiple-ways).

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Code mechanisms to bypass blocks of content repeated on multiple pages.
* Ensure content follows a meaningful sequence.
* Describe mechanisms to navigate across web pages and to find content using:
  * Page titles.
  * Page language.
  * Content language.
  * Search functions.
  * Site maps.
  * Breadcrumb trails.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Demonstrate use of HTML links that allow to bypass blocks of content that repeats on multiple pages. Explain that keyboard-only users and users with motor disabilities rely on them to jump to the specific content of a web page, or to skip large blocks of navigation. Link this requirement to WCAG success criterion [2.4.1 Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#bypass-blocks).
* Show content in different layouts, for example, with different style sheets applied. Emphasize that content always needs to follow a meaningful sequence that allows to adapt the content to different ways of presentation. For information on how to ensure a meaningful sequence, see technique [G57: Ordering the content in a meaningful sequence](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G57).
* Demonstrate use of the `title` element within the `head` element to convey the topic or purpose of the page. Show examples of where and how browsers and assistive technologies show the contents of the `title` element: screen reader keystrokes, browser tabs, browser window titles, and search results. Relate this requirement to WCAG success criterion [2.4.2 Page Titled](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#page-titled). For reference on how to provide descriptive titles, see technique [G88: Providing descriptive titles for Web pages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G88.html) and [H25: Providing a title using the title element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H25). For best practices on how to write page titles, see the Easy Checks resource, section [Page title](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#title).
* Demonstrate use of the `lang` attribute to convey the main language of a web page. Explain that it is placed within the `html` tag, and that it takes a value from [BCP47: Tags for the identification of languages](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt). For reference on how to convey the main language of a web page, see technique [H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57.html).
* Emphasize that, when there is a passage of text in a different language than the default, the `lang` attribute needs to be used with a value that corresponds to the language of that passage. For an explanation of how to use the `lang` attribute to convey changes in language, see [H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H58.html).
* Show examples of different ways to find content withing web pages, such as search functions, site maps, or breadcrumb trails. For references on how to build mechanisms that help people find content within pages, see techniques [G161: Providing a search function to help users locate content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G161.html),  [G63: Providing a site map](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G63), and [G65: Providing a breadcrumb trail](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G65).
