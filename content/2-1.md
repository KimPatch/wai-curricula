## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module:

* Present several interaction patterns for an accessible user experience.
* Introduce some HTML elements to convey structure and semantics in websites.

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* Understand how different assistive technology users orient and navigate web pages.
* Markup the different sections of a web page.
* Convey the structure of text passages with headings.
* Markup passages of text, for example paragraphs, lists, and tables.
* Provide contextual information to facilitate web page orientation and navigation.

## Competencies

Skills required for this module.

Students:

* Basic understanding of:
  * Accessibility concepts and terminology.
  * How people with disabilities use the Web.
  * HTML sectioning elements.

Instructors:

* In-depth knowledge of:
  * How people with disabilities use the Web (including assistive technologies and adaptive strategies).
  * The links between components of web accessibility.
  * Accessibility principles.  
  * The W3C accessibility standards.
* Experience with:
  * HTML5 sectioning elements.
  * WAI-ARIA landmarks.

## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

#### Topic: Headings

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the role of headings to identify and label sections of a web page. Explain that they are used by some assistive technology users to orient and navigate.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Understand some assistive technology user strategies to move through headings in a web page.
* Code headings using the `h1` through `h6` HTML tags.
* Rank headings according to the hierarchical structure of the page.
* Describe the passages of text entitled by the heading with heading inner text.

#### teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach de learning outcomes.

* Demonstrate use of some keystrokes of screen readers to move through the headings in a sequential order. Explain that screen readers also have advanced functionality that allow to present all headings in a list, where users can select the one they want to get to.
* Explain that headings are organized in a hierarchical structure, i.e., h1 being the top most and h6 being the bottom most in the structure. This way, subsections of content begin with the next number in height, and newer sections of content can go back to higher levels according to the overall structure of the page. 
* Explain that text of headings needs to be descriptive of the section they entitled.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to assess knowledge.

[To be developed].

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Page Regions

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce ways to markup regions of a web page.

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able  to:

* [In progress].Understand some assistive technology user strategies to navigate through the different sections of the web page.
* Code regions of a page using `header`, `nav`, `main`, `complementary`, and `footer`, elements.
* Label regions using headings, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`.
* Markup sections of a web page with ARIA landmarks to make regions available for the greatest number of browsers and assistive technologies possible.

#### [Work in Progress] teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach de learning outcomes.

* Demonstrate use of some mechanisms of screen readers to get to different regions of a web page. Introduce specific keystrokes used to get to each region in a sequential order. Demonstrate More advanced functionality presents all the regions of a web page in a tree list. Mention that these structural components help users orient and navigate web pages.
* Demonstrate use of some browser extensions that allow users to get to the main region of a web page. Explain that these are a navigational mechanism for keyboard only users mainly.
* Introduce the `header` element. Explain that it is generally found at the top of the web page, and that it contains information about the web site, the logo, and possibly its main navigation. For guidance on how to use it, see the WAI website tutorials, [Page Header](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#page-header).
* Introduce the `footer` element. Explain that it generally contains copyright information, privacy statements, or disclaimers. For guidance on how to use it, see the WAI website tutorials, [Page Footer ](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#page-footer).
* Introduce the `main` element. Explain that it contains the main (and generally unique) content of the web page in the context of a set of web pages. For reference on how to use it, see the WAI website tutorials, [Main Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#main-content)
* Introduce the aside` element. Explain that it marks up complementary regions, generally within the main content, that can convey meaning by themselves. For guidance on how to use it, see the WAI website tutorials, [Complementary Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#complementary-content).
* Explain that ARIA landmarks provide broader support for old assistive technologies and browsers. Emphasize that they can also enhance HTML 4 semantics if applied to an ordinary `div` element. For uses of ARIA landmarks associated to their corresponding HTML5 elements, or complementing HTML4 semantics, see  the WAI website tutorials [Page Regions in HTML5 Using WAI ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#accessupport), and [Page Regions in HTML4 Using WAI ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#accessupport))]

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to assess knowledge.

[To be developed].

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

#### Topic: Marking up Page Contents

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce some strategies to identify page contents.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Markup the different sections of the content with the `section` or `article` elements.
* Markup the different paragraphs of the content with the `p` element.
* Markup lists of items with `ul`, `ol`, or`dl` elements.
* Code tables with the `table` element, and associate header and data cells with `th` and `td` elements, respectively.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

#### Topic: Contextual Information of Pages

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce mechanisms that help identify pages and page features in the context of a website.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Markup and describe page titles with the `title` element.
* Markup the main language of a page with the `lang` attribute.
* Markup language different than the default using the `lang` attribute.

### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Introduce the `lang` attribute and explain that it takes a value from the language subtag registry from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Emphasize that assistive technologies rely on the `lang` attribute to speak contents using the appropriate speech engine.
* Demonstrate use of the `lang` attribute to convey the main language of a web page. Explain that it is placed within the `html` tag. Mention that this is a requirement under success criteria [3.1.1 Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#language-of-page)
* Emphasize that, when there is a passage of text in a different language than the default, the `lang` attribute needs to be used, for example in a `div` wrapping the content with the new language. Explain that these are WCAG requirements under success criteria [3.1.2 Language of Parts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#language-of-parts). For an explanation of how to use the `lang` attribute to convey changes in language, see [H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H58.html)
