## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module:

* Explain the concept of semantics and how it applies to accessibility.
* Introduce several HTML5 and WAI-ARIA elements to convey structure.

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* Explain what semantics means in the context of web accessibility.
* Distinguish different parts of a web page.
* Use HTML5 and WAI-ARIA elements to convey semantics in web pages, applications, and content.
* Use headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes, tables, figures, and images to convey the structure of web content.
* Determine if these elements:
  * Are used according to the specifications.
  * Meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).


## Teaching Ideas

* Define semantics in the context of web accessibility. For reference, see [3.2.1 Semantics](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#semantics-2), and [ARIA can both cloak and enhance](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices#principle-2-aria-can-both-cloak-and-enhance-creating-both-power-and-danger)
* Provide examples of HTML5 and WAI-ARIA elements that help conveying semantics. For example, refer to regions, articles, sections, paragraphs, quotes, and figures.
