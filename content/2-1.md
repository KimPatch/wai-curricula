## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module:

* Explain some concepts related to accessible development.
* Introduce several interaction patterns that are needed for an accessible user experience.
* Present several HTML5 and WAI-ARIA elements to convey structure and semantics.

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* Recognize how some users interact with websites and applications.
* Use focus management and visibility techniques to allow for browsing and interaction.
* Distinguish different parts of a web page.
* Use HTML5 and WAI-ARIA elements to convey structure and semantics in web pages, applications, and content.
* Determine if the above elements:
   * Are used according to the specifications.
  * Meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

## Competencies

Skills required for this module.

Students:

* Basic understanding of:
  * Computers and the Web.
  * Accessibility concepts and terminology.
  * How people with disabilities use the Web.

Instructors:

* In-depth knowledge of:
  * How people with disabilities use the Web (including assistive technologies and adaptive strategies).
  * The links between components of web accessibility.
  * Accessibility principles.  
  * The W3C accessibility standards.
  * HTML, DOM, and CSS specifications.
  * ECMAScript programming language.

## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Keyboard Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce some aspects related with how a keyboard-only user interacts with websites and applications.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Identify use of the Tab and Shift + Tab keys to navigate forward and backwards through the different components of a user interface.
* Identify use of the arrow keys to make selections within components and scroll through the page.
* Recognize ways to indicate where users are using focus order, focus management, and visibility techniques.
* Recognize ways to enter and exit from a widget with the keyboard only.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Explain that some users interact with websites and applications using the keyboard only. Emphasize that some native HTML elements support these interactions by default. Explain that custom controls may require additional work from the developers' side.
* Demonstrate use of the tab key to move between different components of a user interface. Underline that focus order allows for consistency between the visual and programmatic order of items within a user interface.
* Explain that visual focus indicators help users know where they are as they browse the interface. Show examples of some default indicators provided by browsers. State that it is sometimes best practice to provide custom indicators to enhance visibility and contrast ratios.
* Demonstrate how the arrow keys can be used to move within a specific component. For example, to select an item of a list, to pick up a date from a calendar, or to scroll through a web page.
* Demonstrate how a modal dialog can be entered and exited using the Enter and Escape keys. Emphasize that this functionality needs to be provided by the developer via JavaScript.
* Encourage students to include testing routines, both automatic and manual, into their development practice. For example, encourage students to try their interfaces with the keyboard only and to make sure they know where they are located at all times.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practice &mdash; Students interact with the keyboard only to complete a given set of form fields. For example, students fill in check-in and check-out dates and payment information for a stay in a hotel.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Which is Which

Introduce the concepts of name, role, and value and how they relate to users of assistive technology.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Identify main accessibility properties and how they are rendered by assistive technologies.
* Identify some native HTML elements and their inherited roles.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Explain how an assistive technology communicates information to the users as they move around. Emphasize that this information is determined by the type of element in use and its accessibility properties.
* Bring in examples of some HTML elements that inherit specific roles and compare them with other custom components who may not. Contrast the amount of work it takes to make custom components accessible with the ease of using native HTML as much as possible.

 #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practice &mdash: Students inspect the accessibility tree for some accessible components such as links with proper texts and form elements with adequate labels.
* Practice &mdash: Students take an inaccessible custom component such as a div button and make it accessible. Assess students' capacity to give them a proper role and value, to Make it focusable, and to provide an accessible focus indicator.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Structure
 
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the concept of structure and relate it to web accessibility. 

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Identify the main sections of a web site.
* Create web page's sections using accessible patterns, elements, and roles.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Introduce the different parts of a website. For example, header, main content, footer, search region, navigation menu, etc. Emphasize that these sections need to be identified both visually and programmatically.
* Provide examples of HTML5 and WAI-ARIA elements that help conveying structure and semantics. For example, refer to headings, HTML sectioning elements, and WAI-ARIA landmarks.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practice &mdash: Students develop a template for a website using HTML5 sectioning elements and headings as well as WAI-ARIA elements to convey the structure of the page.
