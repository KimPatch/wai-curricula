## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module:

* Introduce the concept of semantics.
* Explain how it can help accessibility.

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* Explain what semantics means in the context of web accessibility.
* Use HTML5 and WAI-ARIA elements to convey semantics in web pages, applications, and content.

## Teaching Ideas

* Define semantics in the context of web accessibility. For reference, see [3 Semantics, structure, and APIs of HTML documents](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html), and [ARIA can both cloak and enhance](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/WD-wai-aria-practices-1.2-20191218/#principle-2-aria-can-both-cloak-and-enhance-creating-both-power-and-danger)
* Provide examples of HTML5 and WAI-ARIA elements that help conveying semantics: regions, articles, sections, paragraphs, quotes, and figures.
