## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module:

* Present several interaction patterns that are needed for an accessible user experience.
* Discuss some HTML5 and WAI-ARIA elements to convey structure and semantics in websites.

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* Recognize some focus management and visibility techniques to allow for browsing and interaction.
* Distinguish different parts of a web page and use the appropriate markup to communicate them in an accessible way.
* Use HTML5 and WAI-ARIA elements to convey structure and semantics in web pages, applications, and content.
* Determine if the above listed elements:
  * Are used according to the specifications.
  * Meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

## Competencies

Skills required for this module.

Students:

* Basic understanding of:
  * Computers and the Web.
  * Accessibility concepts and terminology.
  * How people with disabilities use the Web.

Instructors:

* In-depth knowledge of:
  * How people with disabilities use the Web (including assistive technologies and adaptive strategies).
  * The links between components of web accessibility.
  * Accessibility principles.  
  * The W3C accessibility standards.
  * HTML, DOM, and CSS specifications.

## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Different Ways of Browsing the Web

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce some aspects related to how users interact with websites and applications. For example, demonstrate how an interface can be navigated using the keyboard only or an assistive tool.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Identify use of:
  * The tab and shift + tab key combinations to navigate forward and backward through the different components of a user interface.
  * The arrow keys to make selections within components and scroll through the page.
* Recognize ways to provide visual cues via focus visibility techniques.
* Acknowledge the relevance of a consistent focus order, both visually and programmatically.
* Recognize ways to enter and exit from a widget with the keyboard only.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Explain that some people cannot use the mouse to interact with websites and applications. Discuss several browsing patterns, such as using the keyboard only or using assistive devices to simulate key presses. Emphasize that some native HTML elements support these interactions by default, but custom controls may require additional work from the developers' side.
* Demonstrate use of the tab and shift + tab keys to move between different components of a user interface. Underline that keeping focus order allows for consistency between the visual and programmatic order of items within a user interface.
* Demonstrate how the arrow keys can be used to move within a specific component. For example, to select an item of a list, to pick up a date from a calendar, or to scroll through a web page.
* Explain that visual focus indicators help users know where they are as they browse the interface. Show examples of some default visual cues offered by browsers. Mention that it is sometimes best practice to provide custom indicators for better visibility and contrast ratios.
* Encourage students to include testing routines, both automatic and manual, into their development process. For example, encourage students to try their interfaces with the keyboard only and to make sure they always know where they are when they navigate them.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practice &mdash; Students interact with the keyboard only to complete a given set of form fields. For example, students fill in name, surname, check-in, check-out and payment information for a stay in a hotel.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Semantics and Structure

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce several accessibility properties and explain that semantics allow assistive technologies to communicate information about the page. Present some structural elements of websites and emphasize how they benefit a great variety of users.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Structure a web page using accessible patterns, elements, and roles.
* Identify some native HTML elements and their inherited roles to reinforce semantics of web content.
* Identify main accessibility properties and how they are communicated by assistive technologies.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Introduce the different regions of a website: header, main content, footer, search region, navigation menu, etc. Emphasize that these sections need to be distinguishable both visually and programmatically. Provide examples of HTML5 and WAI-ARIA elements that help conveying structure and semantics. For example, refer to HTML5 headings and sectioning elements, and WAI-ARIA landmarks.
* Bring in examples of some HTML elements that inherit semantic roles and compare them with other custom components which may not. Contrast the amount of work it takes to make custom components accessible with the ease of using native HTML as much as possible.
* Explain how an assistive technology communicates information to users as they move through the website. Emphasize that this information is determined by the type of element in use and its accessibility properties. Indicate that some users can quickly get to these sections by using specific key combinations of their assistive products or extensions of their browsers.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practice &mdash; Students develop a template for a website using HTML5 sectioning elements and headings as well as WAI-ARIA elements to convey the structure of the page.
* Practice &mdash; Students provide appropriate HTML markup for a given piece of content. Assess students' capacity to identify and use headings, lists, paragraphs, quotes, tables, etc., to convey the visual appearance of the content.
* Practice &mdash; Students inspect the accessibility tree for some accessible components such as links with proper texts and form elements with adequate labels.
* Practice &mdash; Students take an inaccessible custom component such as a div button and make it accessible. Assess students' capacity to give it an appropriate role, name, and value, to Make it focusable, and to provide an accessible focus indicator.
