## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

#### Topic: Headings

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the role of headings to identify and label page regions and sections of content. Explain that they are used by some assistive technology users to orient and navigate.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe how users interact and move to headings in a web page using:
  * Specific keystrokes to go to next or previous heading.
  * Advanced functionality that presents all headings in a list.
  * Browser extensions that outline the heading structure in a page.
* Code headings using the `h1` through `h6` HTML tags.
* Rank headings according to the hierarchical structure of the page.
* Describe the passages of text entitled by the heading with the heading's inner text.

#### teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach de learning outcomes.

* Demonstrate use of some keystrokes of screen readers to move through the headings in a sequential order. Explain that screen readers also have advanced functionality that allows to present all headings in a list out of context, where users can select the one they want to get to. For reference on how screen reader users interact and navigate web pages, see How People with Disabilities Use the Web story for  [Ilya, senior staff member who is blind](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#accountant)
* Explain that headings are organized in  hierarchical structure, i.e., h1 being the topmost and h6 being the bottom most in the structure. This way, subsections of content begin with the next number in height, and newer sections of content can go back to higher levels according to the overall structure of the page. For several examples on how to structure pages using headings, see the WAI website tutorials, section [Headings that Reflect the Page Organization](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/#headings-that-reflect-the-page-organization).
* Explain that text of headings needs to be descriptive of the section they entitled. For reference on how to use headings to organize passages of text, see the WAI website tutorials, section [Organize passages of text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/#organize-passages-of-text).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to assess knowledge.

* Research &mdash; Students research the documentation of their screen reader of choice and find keystrokes to navigate headings, as well as mechanisms to reveal the list of headings in a page.
* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked how many ranks are in the heading structure and how each of these ranks can be coded. Assess students' knowledge of the `h1` through `h6` tags.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a website and are asked to use `h1` through `h6` tags to indicate its structure. Assess how students relate the visual layout of the page with the underlying structure.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with headings that do not describe the sections they entitle and are asked to replace their inner text with descriptive information. Assess how students provide descriptive titles for sections.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Page Regions

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce ways to markup regions of a web page.

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able  to:

* Describe how people interact and move to the different regions of a web page using:
  * Specific keystrokes to go to next or previous region.
  * Advanced functionality that presents all regions in a list or tree.
  * Browser extensions that outline the regions of a page.
* Code regions of a page using `header`, `nav`, `main`, `complementary`, and `footer`, elements.
* Label regions using headings, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`.
* Markup regions of a web page with ARIA landmarks to make regions available for the greatest number of browsers and assistive technologies possible.

#### teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach de learning outcomes.

* Demonstrate use of some mechanisms of screen readers to get to different regions of a web page. Introduce specific keystrokes used to get to each region in a sequential order. Demonstrate advanced functionality that presents all the regions of a web page in a tree list out of context. Mention that these structural components help users orient and navigate web pages. For reference on how screen reader users interact and navigate web pages, see How People with Disabilities Use the Web,  [Ilya, senior staff member who is blind](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#accountant).
* Demonstrate use of some browser extensions that allow users to get to the main region of a web page. Explain that these are a navigational mechanism for keyboard only users mainly.
* Explain that the `header` element is found at the top of the web page, and that it contains general information about the site, the logo, and possibly main navigation for the site. For guidance on how to use the `header` element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Page Header](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#page-header).
* Explain that the `footer` element generally contains copyright information, privacy statements, or disclaimers. For guidance on how to use the `footer` element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Page Footer](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#page-footer).
* Explain that the `main` element contains the main (and generally unique) content of the web page in the context of a set of web pages. For reference on how to use the `main` element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Main Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#main-content)
* Explain that the `aside` element marks up complementary regions, generally within the main content, that can convey meaning by themselves. For guidance on how to use the `aside` element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Complementary Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#complementary-content).
* Explain that ARIA landmarks provide broader support for old assistive technologies and browsers. Emphasize that they can also enhance HTML 4 semantics if applied to an ordinary `div` element. For uses of ARIA landmarks associated to their corresponding HTML5 elements, or complementing HTML4 semantics, see the WAI website tutorials [Page Regions in HTML5 Using WAI ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#accessupport), and [Page Regions in HTML4 Using WAI ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#accessupport))].

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to assess knowledge.

* Research &mdash; Students research the documentation of their screen reader of choice and find keystrokes to navigate regions, as well as mechanisms to reveal the list of regions in a page.
* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked how many types of regions can be in a web page and how each of these can be coded. Assess students' knowledge of the different regions of the page and how to code them.
* Students are presented with a web page and are asked to code its different regions. Assess students' knowledge of the different types of regions of a web page.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

#### Topic: Marking up Page Contents

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce some strategies to markup page contents.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Markup sections of content with the `section` or `article` elements.
* Markup paragraphs with the `p` element.
* Markup lists of items with `ul`, `ol`, or `dl` elements.
* Code tables with the `table` element, and associate header and data cells with `th` and `td` elements, respectively.

### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Introduce the `section` element. Define it as a thematic grouping of content. For an example of how to code the `section` element, see the WAI website tutorials, [Section](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#sections).
* Define the `article` element as a self-containing unit within the web page. For an example of how to use the `article` element, see the WAI website tutorials, section [Article](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#articles).
* Explain that the `p` element needs to be used to mark up paragraphs of text. Explain that it improves readability for all users. For an example of how to code the `paragraph` element, see the WAI website tutorials, section [Paragraph](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#paragraphs).
* Explain that unordered lists are used to group items where the numbering is not relevant. Explain that the list is coded with the `ul` element, and each of the items is coded with the `li` element. Emphasize that each of the list items can contain headings, paragraphs, or other lists. For an example of how to use unordered lists, see the WAI website tutorials, section [unordered list](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#unordered-list).
* Explain that ordered lists are used when numbering of items matters. Explain that the `ol` element is used to code the list, and that each of the list items is wrapped in a `li` item. For an example of how to use ordered list, see the WAI website tutorials, section [Ordered list](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#ordered-list).
* Define description lists as a grouping of several terms and descriptions. Definition lists are coded with the `dl` element, terms are coded with a `dt` element, and descriptions are marked up with a `dd` element. For examples of how to use description lists, see the WAI website tutorials, section [Description Lists](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#description-lists).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to assess knowledge.

* Research &mdash; Students research the HTML specification and provide information about the different ways of coding sections of content. Assess students' knowledge of the HTML element for marking up content.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with several types of lists and are asked to code them using their corresponding HTML list element. Assess students' knowledge of the different types of lists.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

#### Topic: Contextual Information of Pages

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce mechanisms that help identify pages and page features in the context of a website.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Markup and describe page titles with the `title` element.
* Markup the main language of a page with the `lang` attribute.
* Markup language different than the default using the `lang` attribute.

### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Introduce the `lang` attribute and explain that it takes a value from the language subtag registry from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Emphasize that assistive technologies rely on the `lang` attribute to speak contents using the appropriate speech engine language.
* Demonstrate use of the `lang` attribute to convey the main language of a web page. Explain that it is placed within the `html` tag. Mention that this is a requirement under success criteria [3.1.1 Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#language-of-page)
* Emphasize that, when there is a passage of text in a different language than the default, the `lang` attribute needs to be used, for example in a `div` wrapping the content with the new language. Explain that these are WCAG requirements under success criteria [3.1.2 Language of Parts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#language-of-parts). For an explanation of how to use the `lang` attribute to convey changes in language, see [H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H58.html)

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to assess knowledge.

* Practice &mdash: Students are presented with a set of web pages and are asked to choose a title that best describes each of the pages and code it appropriately. Assess students' knowledge of the `title` element.
* Research &mdash: Students research the language subtag registry from IANA and find out the language code for at least five languages. Assess students' understanding of the different types of language codes available.
