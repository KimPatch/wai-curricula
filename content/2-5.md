## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This module introduces techniques to create accessible forms.

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* Recognize how some users navigate, fill in, and receive information generated by form fields.
* Label controls appropriately so that they can be identified by users and ATs.
* Group controls when they are related to each other.
* Provide instructions so that users know how to complete the form.
* Notify users of any errors or successes during form completion.
* Determine if labels and instructions are sufficient for an AT user to complete the form.
* Analyze if all form controls are keyboard accessible.

## Competencies

Skills required for this module.

Students:

* Basic understanding of:
  * Accessibility concepts and terminology.
  * How people with disabilities use the Web.
* Experience with:
  * HTML `input` elements.

Instructors:

* In-depth knowledge of:
  * How people with disabilities use the Web (including assistive technologies and adaptive strategies).
  * The links between components of web accessibility.
  * Accessibility principles.  
  * The W3C accessibility standards.
* Experience with:
  * HTML`input` elements.
  * ECMAScript programming language.
  * WAI-ARIA live regions.

## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Filling in the Form

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce several strategies for some user groups to navigate, understand, and fill in form fields.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Recognize that keyboard users navigate through form fields using the tab key.
* Acknowledge that screen reader users perceive one form field at a time.
* Acknowledge that screen reader users only perceive information attached to focusable elements as they navigate using the so-called forms mode.
* Recognize that users with low vision or with mobility impairments need larger targets to interact with form fields.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to support your teaching.


#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

### Topic: Identifying Form Labels

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Present strategies to label form controls and make them understandable.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Use the `label` element to provide form fields with a meaningful label.
* Use the `for` attribute to programmatically associate labels with input fields.
* Use the `fieldset` and `legend` elements to associate several form fields together that share the same purpose.
* Demonstrate knowledge about other methods to provide additional instructions within labels, such as the `title`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-describedby` attributes.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Validating User Input

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Present several HTML5 input types and additional techniques that allow for predictability and help users complete the form fields.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Use the `required` attribute to denote that a form field cannot be left empty.
* Demonstrate knowledge of several HTML5 input types that allow validation for specific types of data or common regular expressions.


{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Notifying Users

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce strategies to inform users about errors or any other warning messages resulting from their input.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Provide information about error messages in the main heading of the page, the page title, or via modal dialogs.
* Use the appropriate markup to list specific form controls with errors.
* Provide inline feedback through messages belonging to specific form controls.
* Use the `aria-labelledby` elements and `aria-live` regions to provide instant feedback as the user is typing in a form field.

## Teaching Resources

Suggested resources to support your teaching:

* [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/people-use-web/) &mdash; Provides stories of people with disabilities using the Web; describes types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* [Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)](/perspective-videos/) &mdash; Is a series of 1-minute videos that demonstrate that web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. They show accessibility features, how they impact people with disabilities, and how they benefit everyone in a variety of situations.
* [WAI Web Accessibility Tutorials](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/) &mdash; shows how to develop web content that is accessible to people with disabilities, and that provides a better user experience for everyone
* WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [ARIA can both cloak and enhance](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices#principle-2-aria-can-both-cloak-and-enhance-creating-both-power-and-danger) section &mdash; provides readers with an understanding of how to use WAI-ARIA to create accessible rich internet applications. 
* HTML5 Specification's [3.2.1 Semantics](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#semantics-2) &mdash;
