## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Consistent Identification

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain use of HTML elements and techniques that people use to navigate, understand, and fill in form fields. For example, clear labels and instructions or large text targets.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe how people identify and fill in form fields using:
  * The tab key or specific keystrokes to move from one form field to the other.
  * Larger targets to interact with form fields.
  * Clear labels and instructions to understand form fields' purpose.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Demonstrate how a set of form elements can be navigated using the keyboard only. Use the tab key to move through different form elements. Use the arrow keys to select options from combo boxes or lists.
* Demonstrate use of the tab key together with a screen reader to complete a set of form elements. Emphasize that screen reader users may only detect information present in the form labels as they are navigating in focus mode. Provide examples of dedicated screen reader keystrokes that they can use to navigate to specific types of form controls, such as e for edit boxes, x for check boxes, or a for radio buttons.
* Demonstrate how users with mobility impairments or low vision users can click the label element to activate a specific form control if both are associated with each other.
* Refer to common pitfalls when completing form elements. For example, in which format a date should be entered or how a phone number should be written. Explain that instructions to complete form fields are essential for users with cognitive disabilities and benefit all users.

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practice &mdash; Students are asked to complete a set of form fields using the keyboard only and a screen reader. Assess students use of the tab and arrow keys and understanding of key combinations of screen readers to move to specific types of form controls.
* Practice &mdash; Students are asked to activate a set of form fields by clicking their labels. Assess how students understand the relevance of proper click targets for users with mobility impairments.

### Topic: Form Labels

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain use of HTML elements and WAI-ARIA attrbutes to label form controls and make them understandable. For example, the `label` element and the `for attribute.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Label form fields using the `label` element.
* Associate labels with input fields using the `for` attribute.
* Group several form fields that share the same purpose with the `fieldset` and `legend` elements.
* Provide additional instructions with the `title`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-describedby` attributes.

#### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Provide examples of explicit and implicit associations with the `label` element. Explain that an implicit association can be achieved by wrapping the `label` element and its content around the form control. Explain explicit associations by means of the `for` attribute, and indicate that its value must be a unique id reference of the form control that the label refers to. For reference on how to label form controls, see the WAI website tutorials [Labeling controls](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/labels/).
* Show examples of form controls that are related to each other, such as check boxes or radio buttons to select possible answers for a given question. Mention that the `fieldset` element is used to group them all, and that the `legend` element provides the label they share. For reference on how to group form controls, see the WAI website tutorials [Grouping controls](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/grouping/).
* Introduce additional means to provide labels when it is not possible to use visible text. For example, the `title`, the `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby` attributes. Mention that the `title` may not be well supported by some assistive technologies. Emphasize that contents provided using WAI-ARIA are available for assistive technologies only and are not visible on screen.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short answer questions &mdash; Students are asked to provide different ways to label form controls using HTML. Assess students' knowledge of the different HTML ways to label form controls.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a group of form controls and are asked to provide a label. Assess how students make use of the `label` element and the `for` attribute, as well as the `title`, `aria-label`, and `aria-labelledby` attributes where necessary.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a set of radio buttons that allow to rate a piece of content based on stars, and a piece of text saying, "Rate this". Students are asked to properly associate them with their overall label. Assess how students use the `fieldset` and `legend` elements.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Input Validation

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain use of HTML5 input types and additional techniques that help users enter information in the expected type and format. For example, `date`, `time`, or `url`.  

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Mark up required form fields with  text or the `required` attribute.
* Validate specific types of data with their corresponding HTML5 input type. For example, `date`, `time`, `url`, or `email`.
* Validate common regular expressions with the `pattern` attribute.

#### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Show examples of required form controls using the `required` element or some added text in the label. For reference on how to validate required input, see the WAI website tutorials [Validating required input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/validation/#validating-required-input).
* Demonstrate use of some common HTML5 elements, such as `date`, `time`, `url`, or `email`. Explain that they allow users to enter data more reliably and help validation. For reference on how to validate common input, see the WAI website tutorials [Validating common input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/validation/#validating-common-input).
* Show examples of the `pattern` attribute together with regular expressions to validate common ways of entering information, such as country codes, phone numbers, or dates.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a set of form fields and are asked to convey those which are required both visually and programmatically. Assess how students make use of the `required` element and/or some text in the label of the form control.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a set of edit boxes for date, time, url, and email. Students are asked to choose an HTML5 input type that serves the specific purpose of each of the fields. Assess students' knowledge of HTML5 form input types.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with form fields that collect phone numbers of a given country and dates of birth. Students are asked to use the `pattern` element and common regular expressions. Assess how students use the `pattern` attribute together with regular expressions to validate the expected input format.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: User Notifications

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain use of HTML and WAI-ARIA elements to inform users about successes, errors, or any other warning messages resulting from their input or from a time limit.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Notify users of existing time limits.
* Provide mechanisms to stop or extend time limits.
* Provide information about the amount of errors in the main heading of the page, the page title, or via modal dialogs.
* Identify error messages with their corresponding form controls with headings, lists, or anchors.
* Provide inline feedback through messages belonging to specific form controls via labels, icons, or the `aria-describedby` attribute.
* Provide instant feedback as the user is typing with `aria-live` regions.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Mention that time limits in forms should be avoided to allow users to complete them at their own pace. Explain that when there is a compelling reason to establish the limit, users must be notified in advance and be provided with a way to extend or stop the limit. If the time limit is essential to a valid submission, then there is no need to allow users to extend or stop the limit.
* Introduce the different ways in which errors can be announced after form submission. Explain that a warning message should be included in the title of the page or its main heading, so that all users are aware that their submissions have produced errors.
* Explain that it is good practice to use lists and list items to group error messages. Add that the messages can link to their corresponding form field by using anchors.
* Introduce mechanisms to provide inline error messages for form fields so that users can relate them to its specific field as they move around. Explain that you can use the `label` element to include that information or use the `aria-describedby` attribute.
* Explain that WAI-ARIA live regions can be used to provide instant feedback as users are typing in a form field or as validation outputs appear so that screen reader users can understand the information provided.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a page where there are form fields visually marked with errors. Students are asked to
  * Indicate the presence of these errors in the main heading or title of the page.
  * Make textual reference to each erroneous field and group those references in a list.
  * Link each list item with its corresponding form field.
  * Provide inline instructions in the corresponding form field that users will read once the form field gets focused.
