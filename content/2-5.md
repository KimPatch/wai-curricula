This module introduces techniques to create accessible forms.

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* Label controls appropriately so that they can be identified by users and ATs.
* Group controls when they are related to each other.
* Provide instructions so that users know how to complete the form.
* Demonstrate knowledge about:
  * Accessible techniques to communicate validation outcomes.
  * Mechanisms to give opportunities to undo or change information provided by the user.
  * Notify users of any errors or successes during form completion.
* Determine if labels and instructions are sufficient for an AT user to complete the form.
* Analyze if all form controls are keyboard accessible.
