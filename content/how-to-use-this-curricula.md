## Introduction

This page provides further guidance on how to use the materials of the WAI Curricula.

It helps you assemble your course by presenting several scenarios to combine the different modules of the curricula according to specific needs.

It also helps you select courses by presenting several indicators when analyzing course offerings.

## Example Scenarios

The following are possible implementations for the WAI Curricula. Some of them take a complete curriculum, some others combine several modules of different curricula to address various roles together.

### Including Accessibility in a University ICT Program

An estimate showing how many ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System) an introduction to web accessibility would take. One ECTS credit corresponds to 25-30 hours of students' workload. 60 credits reflect a complete year of students' workload.

### MOOC Course

A MOOC course for those who want to learn the fundamentals of web accessibility. It is designed to be open and fully online. A public implementation can be found at [Introduction to Web Accessibility (EDX)](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction).

## Course Indicators

The following is a list of indicators to compare and select courses based on the WAI Curricula.

### Learning Outcomes
Learning outcomes are usually defined as what a student should be able to demonstrate after completion of a particular course.

Ask for mappings that demonstrate how the course addresses learning outcomes in the curricula. The course does not need to follow the specific order in which learning outcomes are outlined. However, it is advisable that:

* Those at a module level are covered.
* Those from the introductory modules are addressed before any other specific role.
* Those related to how people with disabilities use the Web are part of the course.

### Teaching Ideas

Focus on how the course offerer plans to teach the learning outcomes. Ask for demonstrations of the strategies used by the instructors and the materials used for the course.
* Will the teaching be face-to-face?
* Will the course be conducted completely online?
* Will teaching strategies include theoretical knowledge of the subjects covered?
* Will such strategies include interaction with assistive technologies, people with disabilities?

### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Focus on how the provider plans to assess knowledge. Ask for specific activities and their expected outcomes, as well as for rating systems (if any). There should be at least one activity per learning outcome.

### Course Accreditation

Ask if the provider offers credentials after course completion. For example, certificates or free choice subject credits. An example of such accreditation system can be found at the [International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/).

### Availability of Materials

Ask the provider how they will make materials available to you and if they are going to let you keep the slides and/or handouts.

### Specific Audience Needs

Make sure the course offerer will cover requirements from all your participants: accessibility needs, cultural preferences. For an understanding of how to make presentations, meetings, talks, and training accessible, you can refer to [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All](/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/).
