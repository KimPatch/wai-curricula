## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This page provides further guidance on how to use the materials of the WAI Curricula.

It helps you:

* Assemble your training by presenting several course scenarios.
* Select courses by presenting several mappings of this curricula that you can base on while building your RFPs.

## Example Scenarios

The following are possible implementations of the WAI Curricula. Some of them are based on a complete curriculum, some others combine different modules for different curricula to address several roles together.

### MOOC Course

A group of organizations develop a MOOC course for those who want to get started with web accessibility. It is designed to be open and fully online. It can be found at [Introduction to Web Accessibility (EDX)](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction).

<table>

### Introduction to Web Accessibility in a University ICT Program

A university wants to include accessibility in their HCI programs. The below shows how many ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System) an introduction to web accessibility course could take. One ECTS credit corresponds to 25-30 hours of students' workload. 60 credits reflect a complete year of students' workload.

### A Face-To-Face Course for Professionals Sharing Different Roles

An organization wants to train their small team in web accessibility. They develop tasks associated to several roles.

## Course Indicators

The following is a list of indicators to compare and select courses based on the WAI Curricula.

### Students' Outcomes

Learning outcomes are usually defined as what a student should be able to demonstrate after completion of a particular course.

Ask for mappings that demonstrate how the course addresses learning outcomes in the curricula. The course does not need to follow the specific order in which learning outcomes are outlined. However, it is advisable that:

* Those at a module level are covered.
* Those from the introductory modules are addressed before any other specific role.
* Those related to how people with disabilities use the Web are part of the course.

### Teaching Abilities

Focus on how the course provider plans to teach the learning outcomes. Ask for demonstrations of the strategies used by the instructors and the materials used for the course.
* Will the teaching be face-to-face?
* Will the course be conducted completely online?
* Will teaching strategies include practical interactions with the knowledge covered?
* Will such strategies include interaction with assistive technologies and people with disabilities?

### Evaluation

Focus on how the provider plans to assess knowledge. Ask for specific activities and their expected outcomes, as well as for rating systems (if any). There should be at least one activity per learning outcome. 

### Course Certificates

Ask if the provider offers credentials after course completion. For example, certificates or free choice subject credits. An example of such accreditation system can be found at the [International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/).

### Availability of Materials

Ask the provider how they will make materials available to you (online/offline consumption). Communicate if you need to keep the slides and/or handouts for future consultation.

### Specific Audience Needs

Make sure the course provider will cover requirements from all your participants: accessibility needs, cultural preferences. For an understanding of how to make presentations, meetings, talks, and training accessible, you can refer to [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All](/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/).
