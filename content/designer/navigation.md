## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain strategies that people with disabilities use to navigate and operate web pages
* create designs that allow for multiple navigational mechanisms, such as menus, search boxes, breadcrumb trails, and sitemaps
* create designs that allow users to bypass blocks of repeated content
* create designs that allow for mechanisms to stop, adjust, and extend time limits
* create designs that allow for mechanisms to pause, stop, or hide any moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating content, such as animations or    carousels
* create designs that allow for mechanisms to stop or control the volume of audio that plays automatically
* ensure interactions do not rely solely on multipoint or path-based gestures, such as swipe or pinch
* ensure that mechanisms to undo or abort an action carried out with pointer operations are always available
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure that navigational mechanisms are operable using the keyboard and other input devices
