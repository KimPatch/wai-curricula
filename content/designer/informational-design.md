[To be developed]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities rely on different means, structures, and techniques for presenting information, such as textual, graphical, tabular, audio, or video information
* identify and describe different uses of text, such as for labels, static content, or dynamic messages
* describe alternative ways to convey information presented in text, such as using graphics, color, or shape
* identify and describe different types of images from an accessibility perspective, such as informative, textual, decorative, functional, and complex images
* identify and describe different types of tables from an accessibility perspective, such as layout, simple, and complex tables
* identify the different types of multimedia content (for example audio or video content), and relate each of them to the user needs of people with disabilities
* provide appropriate text alternatives for images included in the design phase, such as logos or graphical components
* provide text that allows users to identify graphical interactive elements such as links or menu items
* create designs that allow to provide accurate descriptions for components such as complex tables, charts, or infographics
* create designs that allow to provide alternatives to multimedia content, such as transcripts for audio or audio described content,
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure that table header cells are programmatically associated to their corresponding data cells
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure alternatives and descriptions are programmatically associated to their corresponding component

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Textual Information

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that support additional ways to convey information presented in text, such as required form fields, using icons, shapes, and colors
* create designs that support mechanisms to identify specific definitions of words and meaning of phrases, such as professional terms, idioms, and jargon
* create designs that support mechanisms to identify the expanded form or meaning of acronyms and abbreviations
* create designs that support alternatives to text that require reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level
* describe related requirements for developers to make language of page and language of parts programmatically determined
* describe related requirements for content authors to provide texts that do not require reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level

### Topic: Graphical Information

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* define the following types of images from an accessibility perspective:
  * informative,
  * textual,
  * decorative,
  * functional,
  * complex images
* create designs that support use of text when the information presented is intended to be read as text, instead of using images of text
* provide names for controls and components that accept user input
* provide descriptive textual information for the following types of graphical information:
  * those that are part of tests or exercises that would be invalid if presented in text
  * those that are primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience
* provide text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of graphical elements that are used to confirm that content is accessed by a person rather than a computer, such as captcha
* ensure several modalities of captcha that rely on different sensory characteristics are provided

### Topic: Tabular Information

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

* define the following types of tables from an accessibility perspective
  * simple tables
  * complex tables
  * layout tables
* create designs that allow presentation of tables in multiple ways, such as using several lists, or splitting a single table into several simpler ones
* create designs that allow to establish a relationship between the table cells both visually and programmatically, included for headers and data cells
* describe related requirements for developers to ensure that table header and data cells are programmatically associated

### Topic: MultiMedia Content

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to

* identify the different types of multimedia content, such as audio and video, and relate them to their corresponding sensory characteristic
* identify the different types of time-based multimedia content, such as pre-recorded and live audio and video
* identify and describe different types of synchronized media, for example a dialog in a movie
* create designs that allow to provide text alternatives for prerecorded audio-only content that presents equivalent information
* create designs that allow to provide either a text alternative or an audio track for a prerecorded video-only content that presents equivalent information
* create designs that allow to provide captions for any prerecorded and live audio content in synchronized media
* create designs that allow to provide audio descriptions for any prerecorded and live video content in synchronized media
* create designs that allow to provide sign language interpretation for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media
