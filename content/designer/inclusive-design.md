[To be developed]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* describe how involving users with disabilities early and throughout in the design and development process can lead to better accessibility of websites and applications
* explain strategies that people with disabilities use to interact with the Web
* ensure applicable accessibility requirements, such as those collected in standards and  policies, are researched and included in the overall project requirements
* ensure people with disabilities are included in different design and development processes and stages, for example in focus groups,  personas, scenarios, and usability testing
* ensure that collected user input includes different groups of users with disabilities and various levels of experience using the Web
* ensure people with disabilities can provide informed consent, respond to questions, and otherwise participate in the design and development processes in an accessible way
