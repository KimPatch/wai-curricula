Courses based on this module should:

[To be developed]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain strategies that people with disabilities use to identify, operate, and interact with widgets
* provide clear and distinguishable names that allow to identify different types of user interface components
* ensure that custom widgets have appropriate labels that describe their purpose
* ensure that meaningful sequence and clear focus indicators for custom widgets are provided through the widget's lifetime
* create designs that allow for mechanisms to pause, stop, and hide any moving, blinking, scrolling, auto-updating, and auto-playing content, such as animations, carousels, or auto-playing audio
* create designs for custom widgets that support operation using the keyboard
* define custom interaction patterns, such as where to place focus when a dialog is open or closed, and what the focus management should be within those dialogs
* define mechanisms that allow users to obtain information about custom interaction patterns, such as specific keyboard shortcuts for applications and expected behavior of custom widgets
* identify related requirements for developers to create designs using native HTML elements to the extent possible and describe their benefits in relation to non-native elements
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure that states and properties of custom widgets, such as expanded, collapsed, visible, or hidden, are distinguishable both visually and programmatically
* identify related requirements for developers to write code for specific keyboard interactions that custom widgets may require

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Labels and Names

#### Learning outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* provide clear and distinguishable names that allow to identify sections of the content, such as different product categories or different parts of the content
* provide clear and distinguishable names that allow to create labels for different user interface components, such as buttons, edit fields, or dropdown lists
* create designs that allow to position labels where users expect them, for example
  * labels for form fields to the left of the field or above in left-to-right languages, or to the right of the field or above it in right-to-left languages
  * labels for radio buttons or checkboxes to the right of the field or below it in left-to-right languages or to the left of the field or below it in right-to-left languages
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure that labels are programmatically associated to their corresponding user interface component

### Topic: Keyboard Input

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* provide designs that support operation with the keyboard
* describe related requirements for developers to ensure every user interface component can be entered, operated, and exited using the keyboard only
* identify situations when it may be necessary to provide  additional keyboard shortcuts, for example when designing a custom functionality
* create designs that allow provision of keyboard shortcuts that avoid conflicts with the operating system, browser, and assistive technologies keyboard shortcuts
* create designs that allow for consistent focus indicators through the whole widget or application lifetime
  
### Topic: Movement and Context

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that allow to pause, stop, or hide any content that blinks, moves, or auto-updates
* ensure flashing content is below the general flash and red flash thresholds
* create designs that allow to provide content that does not flash more than three times in a second
* create designs that allow to disable motion animation triggered by interaction, such as additional animations when scrolling
* create designs that support mechanisms to stop or control the volume of any audio that plays automatically for more than 3 seconds
* create designs that prevent changes of context unless the user is aware of them or has explicitly requested such changes

### Topic: Notifications

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

* create designs that allow users to switch notifications on or off to avoid 
* identify different types of notifications based on their priority, relevance, and relation to specific parts of the application or to the application as a whole
* create designs that support mechanisms to queue and prioritize application notifications coming from different user interface components and custom widgets
