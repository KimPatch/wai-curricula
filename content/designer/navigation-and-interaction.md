[To be developed]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain strategies that people with disabilities use to navigate and interact with web pages
* create designs that allow users to bypass blocks of repeated content
* create designs that allow for multiple navigational mechanisms, such as menus, search boxes, breadcrumb trails, tables of contents, and sitemaps
* create designs that allow for mechanisms to stop, adjust, and extend time limits
* create designs that allow for mechanisms to pause, stop, or hide any moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating content, such as animations or    carousels
* create designs that allow for mechanisms to stop or control the volume of audio that plays automatically
* ensure interactions do not rely solely on multipoint or path-based gestures, such as swipe or pinch
* ensure that mechanisms to undo or abort an action carried out with pointer operations are always available
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure that navigational mechanisms can be used with the keyboard and other input devices

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:
### Topic: Navigational Mechanisms

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that support skipping blocks of repeated content providing at least one of the following techniques:
  * a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area 
  * a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block 
  * links at the top of the page that go to each area of the content
  * an expandable and collapsible menu to bypass block of content 
* create designs that support site maps to provide an overview of the entire site
* create designs that support breadcrumb trails to provide information about the user's location in a set of web pages
* create designs that support table of contents to give an overview of the whole site or document and to allow users to go to specific parts of the content

### Topic: Enough Time

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that allow users to turn off existing time limits
* create designs that allow users to adjust existing time limits at least ten times the original setting
* create designs that support extending existing time limits by warning the user at least twenty seconds before the time limit expires
* ensure content that auto scrolls can be paused and resumed from where it was left to allow users to better read and process content

### Topic: Input Modalities

Students should be able to:

* create designs that support alternatives to multi-pointer gestures using single pointer activation
* ensure down event on single pointer gestures either:
  * do not perform any action
  * have available mechanisms to abort or undo any action carried on
* create designs that support alternatives to devise or user motion such as shaking, by using user interface components that do not require motion
* ensure response to motion can be disabled by the user to prevent accidental actuation, such as undoing an action by shaking a device
