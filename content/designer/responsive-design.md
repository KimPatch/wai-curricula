## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* create designs that allow for target sizes that can be tapped by users with mobility impairments and using different input methods
* ensure meaningful sequence, content, and functionality are preserved when using different viewport sizes, screen configurations, and devices to access content
* create designs that allow to preserve content and functionality when line height as well as spacing between paragraphs, words, and letters are modified by the user
* create designs that allow text resizing without loss of content and functionality
* create designs that do not restrict the content view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape

## Competencies

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Responsive Design

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that preserve content and functionality when accessed using a variety of screen sizes and configurations
* ensure target sizes that are at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels
* ensure content can be presented without loss of information and functionality, and that accessing such content does not require two dimensional scrolling:
  * vertically at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels
  * horizontally at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels
* create designs that allow text resizing up to 200% without loss of content and functionality
* create designs that allow users to set the orientation to  portrait or landscape, or that include show or hide controls to access contents in portrait and landscape orientations

### Topic: Text Spacing

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic
