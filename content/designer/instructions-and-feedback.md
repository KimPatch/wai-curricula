## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities rely on instructions and feedback to understand and interact with components such as forms and widgets
* provide clear and distinguishable labels that allow to identify different components
* provide overall instructions to help users understand and interact with forms and widgets, such as:
  * allowed data formats
  * required and optional input
  * explanations of what will happen when a change in a control results in a change of context
  * ways to stop and resume sessions
* provide overall instructions about existing time limits in a form and provide specific feedback when such time limits are about to expire
* provide clear instructions about the current step and about the total number of steps involved in a multi-step form
* provide meaningful and descriptive notification messages about errors, successes, or any other event resulting from user input
* ensure that notification messages are easy to understand and can be distinguished from any other component
* provide clear warnings about imminent time limits,, and ensure mechanisms are available to stop and extend time limits
* provide suggestions for error correction when they are known
* create designs that allow for mechanisms to reverse, check, and confirm submissions in legal or financial transactions
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure that labels, instructions, and feedback can be programmatically associated with their corresponding control or component
