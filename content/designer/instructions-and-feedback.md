Courses based on this module should:

[To be developed]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities rely on instructions and feedback to understand and interact with components such as forms and widgets
* provide overall instructions to help users understand and interact with forms and widgets, such as:
  * allowed data formats
  * required and optional input
  * explanations of what will happen when a change in a control results in a change of context
  * ways to stop and resume sessions
* provide clear instructions about the current and total number of step and about existing time limits in a form
* provide meaningful and descriptive notification messages about imminent time limits, errors, successes, or any other event resulting from user input
* ensure that notification messages are easy to understand and can be distinguished from any other component
* provide suggestions for error correction when they are known
* provide clear warnings about imminent time limits,, and ensure mechanisms are available to stop and extend time limits
* create designs that allow for mechanisms to reverse, check, and confirm submissions in legal or financial transactions
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure that instructions and feedback can be programmatically associated with their corresponding control or component

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Overall Instructions

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* provide overall instructions to help users understand the purpose and intent of interactive user interface components, such as form fields
* provide overall instructions about how data should be entered, such as date formats and particular patterns that specific form fields may require
* provide instructions about which input fields are required by:
  * including information about each of the required form fields before the form control
  * including text, icons, and color in the label of each of the required form fields that indicates that they are required
* provide clear instructions of changes in context that happen when there is a change  on a control before the control, for example when launching a new window when the user checks a check box or selects a list item
* provide overall instructions about existing time limits in a form and about how they can be turned of,, adjusted, or extended
* provide clear instructions about the current step and about the total number of steps involved in a multi-step form

### Topic: Feedback and Notifications

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* ensure notification messages are easy to understand, and can be distinguished from any other user component
* provide textual information about errors, successes, or any other information resulting from user input 
* create designs that allow to associate notification messages, errors, and warnings to the component that generated such messages
* describe related requirements for developers to ensure that notification messages are associated to their corresponding user interface component and can be rendered by assistive technologies
