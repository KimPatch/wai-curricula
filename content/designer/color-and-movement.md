## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module should:

* demonstrate how people with disabilities read and understand information in websites and applications based on color properties
* explain how different types of content movement (such as blinking and scrolling) affect the ability of people with disabilities to interact and consume information

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities identify and distinguish different user interface components based on color properties
* create designs that allow for adequate contrast ratios between foreground user interface components (such as text, images of text, and controls) and their corresponding background
* create designs that allow for clear and distinguishable focus indicators, for example using borders, background color, and highlighting
* create designs that allow for mechanisms to pause, stop, and hide any moving, blinking, scrolling, and auto-updating content, such as animations or carousels
* create designs that allow for mechanisms to stop or control the volume of audio that plays automatically
* ensure that different page regions and user interface components are distinguishable from one another through different means, such as color, typography, and borders
* ensure additional mechanisms apart from color alone are available to convey information, such as text cues, patterns, and icons

## Competencies

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Contrast Ratios

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain how contrast ratios allow people with disabilities to read, understand, and distinguish foreground from background user interface components
* create designs that allow text and images of text to have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 with respect to their background
* create designs that allow for large-scale text and images of text to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with respect to their background
* create designs that allow user interface components and graphical elements to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with respect to their background
* ensure focus indicators have a contrast ratio that allows them to be perceived by users

### Topic: Time, Movement, and Animations

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that allow to stop, adjust, or extend any time limit set by the content
* create designs that allow to pause, stop or hide any content that blinks, moves, or auto-updates
* ensure flashing content is below the general flash and red flash thresholds
* create designs that allow content that does not flash more than three times in a second
* create designs that allow to disable motion animation triggered by interaction, such as additional animations when scrolling

### Topic: Section and Content Identification

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* ensure distinguishable styles are applied to different page regions, such as header, navigation, main, or footer
* ensure distinguishable styles are used to identify different components, such as text, links, buttons, or form elements
* create designs that allow for text cues to convey any information that is provided using color alone, such as an asterisk to convey required form fields in a form
* ensure that information conveyed through differences in text color is also conveyed using other visual cues, such as underline, bold, and italics
* ensure that information provided using differences in color is also provided using different patterns, shapes, and icons
