## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities rely on layout and spacing to orient themselves in web pages and applications
* ensure page regions are placed where expected depending on their type and function, for example, page headers  at the top and page footers at the bottom
* ensure headings are nested according to the hierarchical structure of the page and describe the topic of the section they entitle 
* ensure white space and proximity help users determine the relations between different page regions and contents
* ensure test target sizes that are at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels
* ensure meaningful sequence is preserved when  using different viewport sizes or different devices to access content
* create designs that allow to preserve content and functionality when line height as well as spacing between paragraphs, words, and letters are modified by the user
* create designs that allow text resizing up to 200% without loss of content and functionality
* create designs that do not restrict the content view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape
