## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities rely on layout and spacing to orient themselves in web pages and applications
* ensure page regions are placed where expected depending on their type and function, for example, page headers  at the top and page footers at the bottom
* ensure headings are nested according to the hierarchical structure of the page and describe the topic of the section they entitle 
* ensure white space and proximity help users determine the relations between different page regions and contents
* create designs that allow for target sizes that can be tapped by users with mobility impairments and using different input methods
* ensure meaningful sequence and content are preserved when  using different viewport sizes or different devices to access content
* create designs that allow to preserve content and functionality when line height as well as spacing between paragraphs, words, and letters are modified by the user
* create designs that allow text resizing without loss of content and functionality
* create designs that do not restrict the content view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Page Layout

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* provide distinctive styles and spacing for each of the page regions, heading levels, and user interface components
* ensure positioning of page regions falls under user expectations, such as headers at the top, footers at the bottom, and navigation regions at the top left
* ensure heading levels are used to convey the hierarchical structure of the content
* ensure heading texts describe the purpose of the section they entitle

### Topic: Responsive Design

#### Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* ensure target sizes that are at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels
* ensure content can be presented without loss of information and functionality, and that accessing such content does not require scrolling:
  * vertically at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels
  * horizontally at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels
* create designs that allow text resizing up to 200% without loss of content and functionality
* create designs that allow users to set the orientation to  portrait or landscape, or that include show or hide controls to access contents in portrait and landscape orientations

### TRopic: Text Spacing

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that prevent loss of content and functionality for the following properties:
  * line spacing to at least 1.5 times the font size
  * Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size
  * Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size
