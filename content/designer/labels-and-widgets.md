## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain strategies that people with disabilities use to identify, operate, and interact with widgets
* ensure that custom widgets have appropriate labels that describe their purpose
* ensure that meaningful sequence and clear focus indicators for custom widgets are provided through the widget's lifetime
* create designs for custom widgets that support interaction using multiple input devices, such as keyboard, 
* define custom interaction patterns, such as where to place focus when a dialog is open or closed, and what the focus management should be within those dialogs
* define mechanisms that allow users to obtain information about custom interaction patterns, such as specific keyboard shortcuts for applications and expected behavior of custom widgets
* identify related requirements for developers to create designs using native HTML elements to the extent possible and describe their benefits in relation to non-native elements
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure that states and properties of custom widgets, such as expanded, collapsed, visible, or hidden, are distinguishable both visually and programmatically
* identify related requirements for developers to write code for specific keyboard interactions that custom widgets may require
