[To be developed]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain strategies that people with disabilities use to identify, operate, and interact with widgets
* provide clear and distinguishable names that allow to identify different types of user interface components
* ensure that custom widgets have appropriate labels that describe their purpose
* ensure that meaningful sequence and clear focus indicators for custom widgets are provided through the widget's lifetime
* create designs for custom widgets that support interaction using multiple input devices, such as keyboard, 
* define custom interaction patterns, such as where to place focus when a dialog is open or closed, and what the focus management should be within those dialogs
* define mechanisms that allow users to obtain information about custom interaction patterns, such as specific keyboard shortcuts for applications and expected behavior of custom widgets
* identify related requirements for developers to create designs using native HTML elements to the extent possible and describe their benefits in relation to non-native elements
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure that states and properties of custom widgets, such as expanded, collapsed, visible, or hidden, are distinguishable both visually and programmatically
* identify related requirements for developers to write code for specific keyboard interactions that custom widgets may require

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Names and Labels

### Learning outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* provide clear and distinguishable names that allow to identify sections of the content, such as different product categories or different parts of the content
* provide clear and distinguishable names that allow to create labels for different user interface components, such as buttons, edit fields, or dropdown lists
* create designs that allow to position labels where users expect them, for example
  * labels for form fields to the left of the field or above in left-to-right languages, or to the right of the field or above it in right-to-left languages
  * labels for radio buttons or checkboxes to the right of the field or below it in left-to-right languages or to the left of the field or below it in right-to-left languages
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure that labels are programmatically associated to their corresponding user interface component

### Topic: Keyboard Input

* provide designs that support operation with different input devices, such as keyboard
* describe related requirements for developers to ensure every user interface component can be entered, operated, and exited using the keyboard only
* provide keyboard shortcuts that do not conflict with the operating system, browser,  and assistive technology shortcuts
  
### Topic: Help and Feedback

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

* create designs that support mechanisms to queu and prioritize notifications from different user interface compontents and custom widgets
