* explain strategies that people with disabilities use to interact with the Web
* ensure applicable accessibility requirements, such as standards and  policies, are researched and included in the overall project requirements
* ensure people with disabilities are included in user research activities, for example in focus groups, use cases, user analysis, personas, scenarios, and usability testing
* ensure that collected user input in user research includes different groups of users with disabilities and various levels of experience using the Web
* ensure people with disabilities can provide informed consent, respond to questions, and perform any other activity required by the research process in an accessible way

* ensure different groups of users with disabilities are included when defining user groups
* ensure different types of accessibility barriers and features are included in the research phase
* ensure applicable accessibility guidelines, standards, and policies are included in the research phase
* determine the characteristics of participants in user research activities based on different factors, such as overall project requirements, level of experience, use of assistive technology, and type of disability
* ensure people with disabilities are involved early and throughout the research processes, including in focus groups, questionnaires, and surveys

### Topic: Requirements

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* ensure different types of user requirements that relate to people with disabilities are considered, for example adequate contrast ratios, availability of content and functionality in different screen sizes and configurations, keyboard compatibility, and use with assistive technologies and adaptive strategies
