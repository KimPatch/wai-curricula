## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* describe how involving users with disabilities early and throughout in the design and development process can lead to overall improved usability for everybody, including people without disabilities
* identify different groups of people with disabilities and explain strategies they use to interact with the Web
* ensure legal requirements related to accessibility are researched and included in the design phase
* ensure that collected user input in user research includes different groups of users with disabilities and various levels of experience using the Web
* ensure people with disabilities are included in design methodologies and techniques, for example in use cases, user analysis, personas, scenarios, and usability testing
* ensure informed consent and other ethical considerations in research practice are observed when working with people, including people with disabilities
* ensure people with disabilities who participate in user research always understand the purpose of the research, and are aware of their right to opt out at any time if so desired

* describe the use of different assistive technologies and adaptive strategies by people with disabilities to interact with web pages and applications
* ensure different groups of users with disabilities are included when working with user groups
* ensure standards and policies that relate to people with disabilities are considered in research, such as accessibility standards or laws promoting inclusion of people with disabilities
* ensure different types of user requirements that relate to people with disabilities are considered, such as adequate contrast ratios, keyboard compatibility, and use of technology that is compatible with assistive technologies and adaptive strategies

### Topic: Analysis

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create personas that include people with different types of disabilities and different levels of experience using the Web
* create use cases and scenarios that include use of the Web or application with different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies
* ensure appropriate relationships are developed when working with people with disabilities
* ensure treatment of people with disabilities is respectful, same as when working with everybody else
* ensure appropriate compensation is provided to people with disabilities
* ensure people with disabilities understand the purpose of your interviews, surveys, and questionnaires and are comfortable during the research activities
* ensure people with disabilities can opt out at any time if they desire


### Topic: Test

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* determine the characteristics of participants in usability testing based on different factors, such as overall project requirements, level of experience, use of assistive technology, and type of disability
* ensure recruitment of participants consider the variety of disabilities, assistive technologies, adaptive strategies, and levels of experience in conjunction with overall usability requirements
* ensure adequate location is chosen to conduct the tests depending on the test goals, assistive technology needs, custom setups, transportation means, accessibility of the facilities, and others
* ensure adequate time for participants to carry on tasks is allocated, such as different time sets for different levels of experience and familiarity with the web or application
