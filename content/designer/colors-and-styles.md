## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module should:

* demonstrate how people with disabilities use colors and styles to identify and distinguish websites and applications
* @@@

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities use colors and styles to identify and distinguish different user interface components
* create designs that allow for  adequate contrast ratios between foreground user interface components (such as text, images of text, and controls) and their corresponding background
* create designs that allow for clear and distinguishable focus indicators, for example using borders, background color, and highlighting
* create designs that allow to avoid seizures and other physical reactions
* ensure that different page regions and user interface components are conveyed using distinguishable styles
* ensure additional mechanisms are available apart from color alone to convey information, such as text cues, patterns, and icons

## Competencies

Skills required for this module:

[To be developed]

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Contrast Ratios

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain how contrast ratios allow people with disabilities to read, understand, and distinguish foreground content from background
* create designs that allow text and images of text to have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 with respect to their background
* create designs that allow for large-scale text and images of text to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with respect to their background
* create designs that allow user interface components and graphical elements to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with respect to their background
* ensure focus indicators have a contrast ratio that allows them to be perceived by users

### Topic: Seizures and Physical Reactions

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* ensure flashing content is below the general flash and red flash thresholds
* create designs that allow content that does not flash more than three times in a second
* create designs that allow to disable motion animation triggered by interaction, such as additional animations when scrolling

### Topic: Content Identification

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Ensure distinguishable styles are applied to different page regions, such as header, navigation, main, or footer
* ensure distinguishable styles are used to identify different components, such as text, links, buttons, or form elements
* create designs that allow for text cues to convey any information that is conveyed using color alone, such as required form fields in a form
* ensure that information conveyed through differences in text color is also conveyed using other visual cues, such as underline, bold, and italics
* ensure that information provided using differences in color is also provided using different patterns, shapes, and icons
