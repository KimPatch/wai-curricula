## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Simple Images

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain the purpose and scope of simple images and graphics, for example, functional, informative, and decorative. Mention scenarios where alternative texts allow people access information which would not be available otherwise. Relate these strategies to WCAG success criterion [1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-content).

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code HTML elements `picture`, `img`, and `<input type="image">`, as well as SVG graphics, using the HTML attributes `alt`, `title`, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`
* define the purpose and scope of simple images, such as functional, informative, and decorative images
* describe strategies to access information contained in simple images and graphics using:
  * screen reader keystrokes to access alternative texts
  * screen readers functionality that present all graphical elements of a page in an isolated list
  * voice commands to focus and interact with functional images
  * alternative texts from mobile devices when images are turned off due to data restrictions
  * search functions that take advantage of better image indexing and ranking when images have alternative texts

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Explain that the HTML attribute `alt` should contain concise and clear information about the image. State that it is not necessary to include the word "image" in the alternative text since that would be separately announced via the HTML element `img`. Mention that when an image is decorative, the value for the `alt` attribute should be empty (""), and, whenever possible, the image should be included in the web page using CSS instead of the HTML element `img`. For reference on how to use `alt` to code alternative texts, see techniques [H2: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H2) and [H37: Using alt attributes on `img` elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H37).
* Demonstrate use of other ways to convey alternative texts, such as the HTML attributes `title`, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`. Explain that these may not be well supported by old browsers and assistive technologies. For reference on how to use `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` to provide descriptions for images, see techniques [ARIA6: Using aria-label to provide labels for objects](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA6.html) and [ARIA10: Using aria-labelledby to provide a text alternative for non-text content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA10.html).
* Show examples of functional, informative, and decorative images and define their scope and purpose. Show the same image in different web pages and explain that an image can belong to different types depending on the context. For references on functional, informative, and decorative images, see the WAI website tutorials, [Decorative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/), [Informative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/), and [Functional Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/#icon-image-conveying-information-within-link-text).
* Demonstrate use of commands, keystrokes, or gestures of assistive technologies to move to next or previous image. Explore advanced functionality which presents all images in a list where users can select the image they are interested in. For reference on how people with disabilities interact and navigate web pages, see [Stories of Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/).
* Explain that images may not be available because of data restrictions or slow connections. Turn off images using common extensions or the settings screen in most browsers. Show and compare pages with and without alternative texts. Emphasize how essential information is often missed due to the lack of alternative texts.
* Explain that alternative texts are one of the techniques used by search engines to determine what an image is about. Indicate that the more accurate an alternative text is, the better your images could rank.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked about the different HTML and WAI-ARIA elements and attributes to provide alternative texts for images. Assess students' knowledge of the different coding techniques to provide alternative texts for images.
* Practical &mdash; Students provide alternative texts for a given set of functional, informative, and decorative images. Assess how students relate a given image with its specific function within a website.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with the same image in different contexts and are asked to provide the corresponding alternative text for each. Assess how students take into account the context of an image to provide its alternative text.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Complex Images

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Describe mechanisms to provide additional descriptions for complex images. For example, the HTML elements `figure` and `figcaption`, or the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby`. Emphasize that some additional descriptions may be provided by content authors. Relate these mechanisms to WCAG success criteria [1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#images-of-text), and [1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#images-of-text-no-exception).

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* mark up additional descriptions for images using one of the following techniques:
  * HTML elements `figure` and `figcaption`
  * WAI─ARIA attribute `aria-describedby`
  * HTML attribute `longdesc`
* Style text decorations using CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts technologies instead of using images of text
* code mathematical expressions  with the MathML language instead of using images of text
* categorize images based on the following types:
  * textual
  * complex
  
#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Explain that sometimes alternative texts are not enough to convey the information of an image. Discuss ways to provide additional descriptions for complex images and groups of images, for example the HTML elements `fig` and `figcaption`, and the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-describedby` or the HTML attribute `longdesc`. For reference on how to describe complex images see the WAI website tutorials, [Complex images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/).
* Explain that many visual effects can now be achieved by using CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts technologies, instead of embedding an image file with text into a web page. For reference on using CSS3 properties to style text decorations, see the WAI website tutorials, [Using CSS](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/#using-css3).
* Explain that the MathML language can be used to code mathematical expressions on the Web. Emphasize that screen reader support for MathML on the Web is growing, but other assistive technology users may need additional browser extensions to access contents in MathML. For reference on how to use the MathML language to code mathematical expressions, see the WAI website tutorials, [mathematical expressions example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images-and-graphics/textual/#mathematical-expressions).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practical &mdash; Students are shown charts and graphics without descriptions and are asked to provide them. Assess how students provide adequate descriptions for complex images.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a set of images of texts and are asked to code them using CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts technologies. Assess students' knowledge of CSS Transforms and CSS Font technologies.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short answer questions &mdash; Students are asked about the mechanisms available for users of assistive technologies to move to next and previous image and to show all the images of a web page in an isolated list. Assess students’ knowledge of mechanisms of assistive technologies to move through images.
* Guided Quiz &mdash; Students are presented with a set of images in the context of a website and give their type and possible alternative text. Assess how students identify different types of images and provide alternative texts based on their purpose and context.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students add different types of images and graphics to the web site they are building. Assess how students code images and graphics and how they provide alternative texts based on their knowledge or with the help of other roles.
