## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module:

* Introduce different user groups and use cases which benefit from accessible images.
* Present some types of images from an accessibility standpoint.
* Provide strategies to make images accessible.

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* Recognize how different users access information contained in graphical elements.
* Distinguish between informative, decorative, functional, text, and complex images.
* Demonstrate knowledge about providing alternative texts for images.
* Determine if an image needs additional description based on their type and context.
* Analyze if an alternative text and/or description for a given image:
  * Conveys its purpose and function.
  * Is communicated appropriately to assistive technologies.
  * Meets success criterion 1.1.1 (Text Alternatives) of WCAG.

## Competencies

Skills required for this module.

Students:

* Basic understanding of:
  * Accessibility concepts and terminology.
  * How people with disabilities use the Web.
  * HTML `img` element.
  * SVG concepts.

Instructors:

* In-depth knowledge of:
  * How people with disabilities use the Web (including assistive technologies and adaptive strategies).
  * The links between components of web accessibility.
  * Accessibility principles.  
  * The W3C accessibility standards.
* Experience with:
  * HTML`img` tag and `alt` attribute.
  * CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts.
  * SVG concepts.

## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Images for All

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Present some use cases and scenarios which benefit from accessible images.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Recognize how screen reader users benefit from text alternatives.
* Identify how people using speech input software can focus and interact with images.
* Acknowledge how users can turn off images while they are browsing on their mobile devices.
* Acknowledge the role of alternative texts to help better image indexing and ranking of images.
* Demonstrate knowledge about how to provide descriptions for images.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional Ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Explain how screen reader users can get information about a given image via the text alternative, a description of the image contents in plain text. State that it is not necessary to include the word "image" in the alternative text, since that piece of information would be separately announced when the image role is used appropriately. Indicate that most screen readers have specific keystrokes to navigate between images, and have functions to show all images of a web page in a list.
* Bring in examples of speech input software and perform the necessary steps to jump through the different images of a page.
* Demonstrate how images may not be always available by turning them off. Refer to the settings screen in most browsers. Show pages with adequate alternative texts. Compare them with others containing inaccurate or non existing alternatives. Emphasize how essential information is often missed due to the lack of text alternatives.
* Explain that search engines use alternative text among other techniques to better determine what  an image is about. Indicate that the more accurate an alternative text is, the better your images could rank.
* Introduce ways to provide alternative texts and descriptions, such as HTML's alt or WAI-ARIA's aria-labelledby attributes.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practice &mdash; Students use a screen reader to navigate through a given set of images that they have not seen before. Afterwards, they are shown the images. Assess students' capacity to provide adequate alternative text for images when necessary.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Including Images in your Website

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce different technologies that can be used to include images and graphics in websites.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Use the `alt` attribute to provide accessible descriptions for images inserted with the `img` tag or the `image` input type of HTML.
* Use CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts technologies to style texts with decorative effect instead of using images of text.
* Use MathML language to convey mathematical expressions instead of using images of text.
* Recognize some strategies to provide long descriptions for images such as:
  * `longdesc` attribute.
  * `figure` and `figcaption` elements.
  * `aria-describedby.

* [Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)](/perspective-videos/) &mdash; Is a series of 1-minute videos that demonstrate that web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. They show accessibility features, how they impact people with disabilities, and how they benefit everyone in a variety of situations.
* [WAI Web Accessibility Tutorials (Images)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images) &mdash; shows how to develop web content that is accessible to people with disabilities, and that provides a better user experience for everyone
* WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [ARIA can both cloak and enhance](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices#principle-2-aria-can-both-cloak-and-enhance-creating-both-power-and-danger) section &mdash; provides readers with an understanding of how to use WAI-ARIA to create accessible rich internet applications. 
* HTML5 Specification's [3.2.1 Semantics](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#semantics-2) &mdash;
