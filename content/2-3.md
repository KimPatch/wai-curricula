## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Types of Images

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Bring in examples of different Types of images based on their function and purpose, for example informative, decorative, or functional. Describe strategies to make them accessible.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Categorize images based on the following types:
  * Decorative.
  * Informative.
  * Functional.
  * Textual.
  * Complex.
* Describe the different approaches for alternative texts based on the above types of images.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes

* Show examples of decorative images. Explain that an image is considered decorative when its purpose is merely ornamental, i.e., it does not add new meaning to the adjacent text and could be removed without losing information. For references on decorative images, see the WAI website tutorials [Decorative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/).
* Show examples of informative images. Explain that these images convey a small piece of information that can generally be expressed using a few words. For reference on informative images see the WAI website tutorials, [Informative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/).
* Show examples of functional images. Explain that they carry out an action on the page when they are pressed, such as print, or send. For reference on functional images, see the WAI website tutorials, [Functional Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/#icon-image-conveying-information-within-link-text).
* Show examples of images of text. Explain that these images are indeed text coded as an image in machine language. Emphasize that text within an image object cannot be interpreted by assistive technologies, cannot be resized, and that its background and foreground colors cannot be modified. For reference on images of text, see the WAI website tutorials, [Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/).
* Show examples of complex images, such as graphs, charts, or diagrams. Contrast them with informative images in that complex images convey information that cannot be expressed in a short phrase or sentence. For reference on complex images, see the WAI website tutorials [Complex Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short answer questions &mdash; Students are asked to describe characteristics of several types of images based on the above categorization. Assess students' knowledge of image types and features.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with the same image in different pages and are asked to provide different alternative texts. Assess how students consider the context of a web page to provide alternative texts.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Simple Images

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain strategies that people use to interact with simple images and graphics, for example, informative and functional images. Mention scenarios where alternative texts can help users access information which would not be available otherwise. Relate these strategies to WCAG success criterion [1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-content).

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Describe strategies to access information contained in simple images and graphics using:
  * Screen reader keystrokes to access alternative texts.
  * Screen readers functionality that present all graphical elements of a page in an isolated list.
  * Voice commands to focus and interact with functional images.
  * Alternative texts from mobile devices when images are turned off due to data restrictions.
  * Search functions that take advantage of better image indexing and ranking when images have alternative texts.
* Code `img` elements and `image` input types with the alt attribute.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Invite students to explore screen readers functionality to get information about a given image via the alternative text, a description of the image contents in plain text. Indicate that most screen readers have specific keystrokes to navigate between images as well as functions to list all alternative texts of a web page. For reference on how screen reader users access information contained in images and graphics, see [Stories of Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/).
* Invite students to explore speech input software to jump through the different images of a page by voicing specific words or phrases. Compare the experience with that of a web page where there is no alternative text.
* Explain that images may not be available because of data restrictions or slow connections. Turn off images using common extensions or the settings screen in most browsers. Show and compare pages with and without alternative texts. Emphasize how essential information is often missed due to the lack of alternative texts.
* Explain that alternative texts are one of the techniques used by search engines to determine what an image is about. Indicate that the more accurate an alternative text is, the better your images could rank.
* Explain that the HTML `alt` attribute should contain concise and clear information about the image. State that it is not necessary to include the word "image" in the alternative text since that would be separately announced via the `img` element. Mention that when an image is decorative, the value for the `alt` attribute should be empty (""). For reference on how to use the `alt` attribute to code alternative texts, see techniques [H2: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H2) and [H37: Using alt attributes on `img` elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H37).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practical &mdash; Students research the documentation of their screen reader of choice and find keystrokes to access information contained in graphical elements, as well as mechanisms to reveal the list of all graphics in a page. Assess students' knowledge of specific keystrokes and functions of screen readers to access information of graphical elements.
* Practical &mdash; Students use speech input software to interact with button or link images. Assess how students relate the functionality of images with their corresponding alternative texts.
* Practical &mdash; Students use the `alt` attribute to provide alternative texts for a given set of functional images. Assess how students relate a given image with its specific function within a website.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Complex Images

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Describe several mechanisms to provide alternative texts for complex images. For example, `alt` text, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`. Emphasize that some additional descriptions may be provided by content authors. Relate these mechanisms to WCAG success criteria [1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#images-of-text), and [1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#images-of-text-no-exception).

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Style animated text with CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts technologies instead of using images of text.
* Mark up additional descriptions for images using one of the following techniques:
  * Elements `figure` and `figcaption`.
  * Attribute `aria-describedby`.
  * Attribute `longdesc`.
* Code SVG graphics with the attributes `alt`, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`.
* Convey mathematical expressions  with MathML language instead of using images of text.
  
#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Explain that sometimes alternative texts are not enough to convey the information of an image. Discuss ways to provide additional descriptions for complex images and groups of images, for example `fig` and `figcaption`, `aria-describedby` or `longdesc`. For reference on how to describe complex images see the WAI website tutorials, [Complex images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/).
* Explain that many visual effects can now be achieved by using CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts technologies, instead of embedding an image file with text into a web page. For reference, see the WAI website tutorials, section [Using CSS](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/#using-css3).
* Explain that the MathML language can convey mathematical expressions on the Web. Emphasize that screen reader support for MathML on the Web is growing, but other assistive technology users may need additional browser extensions. For reference, see the WAI website tutorials, section [mathematical expressions example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images-and-graphics/textual/#mathematical-expressions).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practical &mdash; Students are shown charts and graphics without descriptions and are asked to provide them. Assess how students provide adequate descriptions for complex images.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a set of images of texts and are asked to code them using CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts technologies. Assess students' knowledge of CSS Transforms and CSS Font technologies.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Guided Quiz &mdash; Students are presented with a set of images in the context of a website and give their type and possible alternative text. Assess how students identify different types of images and provide alternative texts based on their purpose and context.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students add different types of images and graphics to the web site they are building. Assess how students code images and graphics and how they provide alternative texts based on their knowledge or with the help of other roles.
