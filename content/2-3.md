## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module:

* Introduce different user groups and use cases which benefit from accessible images.
* Introduce some types of images from an accessibility standpoint.
* Provide strategies to create an adequate alternative text and/or description for an image (if any).

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* Recognize how different users access information contained in graphical elements.
* Distinguish between informative, decorative, functional, text, and complex images.
* Demonstrate knowledge about providing alternative texts for images.
* Determine if an image needs additional description based on their type and context.
* Analyze if an alternative text and/or description for a given image conveys its purpose and function, and is communicated appropriately to assistive technologies.

## Competencies

Skills required for this module.

Students:

* Basic understanding of:
  * Computers and the Web.
  * Accessibility concepts and terminology.
  * How people with disabilities use the Web.

Instructors:

* In-depth knowledge of:
  * How people with disabilities use the Web (including assistive technologies and adaptive strategies).
  * The links between components of web accessibility.
  * Accessibility principles.  
  * The W3C accessibility standards.
  * HTML, DOM, and CSS specifications.
  * ECMAScript programming language.

## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Images for All

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Present some use cases and scenarios which benefit from accessible images.

#### Learning Outcomes

* Recognize how screen reader users benefit from text alternatives that can be read aloud and/or shown in a braille device.
* Identify how people using speech input software can focus an image by issuing a voice command.
* Acknowledge how users can turn off images while they are browsing on their mobile devices.
* Acknowledge the role of alternative texts to help better image indexing and ranking of images.

### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Explain how screen reader users can get information about a given image via the text alternative, a description of the image contents in plain text. State that it is not necessary to include the word "image" in that text, since that piece of information would be separately announced if the image role of the accessibility tree is used appropriately.
* Bring in examples of speech input software and perform the necessary steps to jump through the different images of a page.
* Demonstrate how images can be turned off in most browsers' settings. Show pages with adequate alternative texts. Compare them with others with inaccurate or non existing alternatives. Emphasize how essential information is often missed due to the lack of text alternatives.
* Explain that search engines use alternative text among other techniques to better determine what  an image is about. Indicate that the more accurate an alternative text is, the better your images could rank.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practice &mdash; Students use a screen reader to navigate through a given set of images with alternative text.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% comment %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

* Demonstrate knowledge about how to provide descriptions for images.

### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Present examples of some alternative texts for images.
* Explain that assistive technologies present to their users the text alternative instead of the image itself.
* Explain how the text alternative can be rendered instead of the image when graphics are not available.
* Introduce ways to provide these descriptions, such as HTML's alt or WAI-ARIA's aria-labelledby attributes. 

{% include excol.html type="end" %}


{% endcomment %}

## Teaching Ideas

* Explain the different types of images and provide definitions and examples. For references, see [Images concepts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/).
