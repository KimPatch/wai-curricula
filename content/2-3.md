## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Images for All

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain how some users interact with accessible images. Mention scenarios where accessible images can help users access information which would not be available otherwise.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* Understand the following user strategies to access information in images and graphics:
  * Specific keystrokes or functions to access text alternatives.
  * Voice commands to focus and interact with functional images.
  * Access to alternative texts from mobile devices when images are turned off due to data restrictions.
  * Better image indexing and ranking of images with the information in their alternative texts.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Explain how screen reader users can get information about a given image via the text alternative, a description of the image contents in plain text. State that it is not necessary to include the word "image" in the alternative text, since that piece of information would be separately announced when the image role is used appropriately. Indicate that most screen readers have specific keystrokes to navigate between images as well as functions to list all text alternatives of a web page.
* Explain how users of speech input software can voice specific words or phrases to jump through the different images of a page. If possible, show live examples of you usign such software in pages with and without accurate alternative texts.
* Demonstrate how images may not be available because of data restrictions or slow connections. Turn them off using common extensions or the settings screen in most browsers. Show pages with adequate alternative texts. Compare them with other images with inaccurate or non-existing alternative texts. Emphasize how essential information is often missed due to the lack of text alternatives.
* Explain that search engines use alternative texts (among other techniques) to better determine what an image is about. Indicate that the more accurate an alternative text is, the better your images could rank.
* Explain that alternative texts are a WCAG requirement under success criterion [1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-content).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practice &mdash; Students are shown image buttons or links without text alternatives and are asked to provide them. Assess how students provide adequate alternative texts for some specific types of images.
* Practice &mdash; Students use a screen reader to navigate through a given set of images that they have not seen before. Assess how students know specific keystrokes and functionality of a screen reader.
* Practice &mdash; Students use speech input software to interact with button or link images. Assess how students relate the functionality of images with their corresponding alternative texts.

### Topic: Including Images in Web Pages

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce different technologies that can be used to make images and graphics accessible based on the type and function of the image.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* List some types of images from an accessibility perspective. For example, informative, functional, text, complex, and decorative images.
* Code `img` elements and `image` input types with the alt attribute to provide accessible descriptions.
* Code SVG graphics with the `alt` attribute, the `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby` properties to provide text alternatives.
* Style animated text with CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts technologies instead of using images of text.
* Convey mathematical expressions  with MathML language instead of using images of text.
* Markup long descriptions for images with one of the following techniques:
  * `longdesc` attribute.
  * `figure` and `figcaption` elements.
  * `aria-describedby`.
  
#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Introduce the different types of images and provide examples for each of them. For reference, see the pages for image types at [Images tutorial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images-and-graphics/).
* Introduce the HTML `alt` attribute. Explain that it should contain concise and clear information about the image. Mention that when an image is decorative, the value for the attribute should be empty ("").
* Introduce CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts technologies. Explain that many visual effects can now be achieved by using these technologies instead of embedding an image file into a website. Explain that this is a WCAG requirement under success criterion [1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#images-of-text). For reference, see the images of text section of the [Images tutorial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images-and-graphics/).
* Introduce the MathML language and explain that it serves to convey mathematical expressions on the Web. Emphasize that screen reader support for MAthML on the Web is growing, but other assistive technology users may need additional browser extensions. Explain that this is a WCAG requirement under success criterion [1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#images-of-text). For reference, see [Images tutorial (mathematical expressions example)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images-and-graphics/textual/#mathematical-expressions).
* Introduce ways to provide additional descriptions for complex images and groups of images such as `aria-describedby` or `longdesc`. Explain that sometimes concise descriptions are not enough to convey the information.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Guided Quiz &mdash; Students are presented with a set of images in the context of a website and give their type and possible alternative text. Assess how students identify different types of images and provide alternative texts based on their context.
* Practice &mdash; Students use the `alt` attribute to provide alternative texts for a given set of functional images. Assess how students relate a given image with its specific function within a website.
* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with a set of images of texts and are asked to code them using CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts technologies and provide mechanisms for authors to include text alternatives and descriptions. Assess students' knowledge of CSS Transforms and CSS Font technologies.

## Teaching Resources

Suggested resources to support your teaching:

* [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/people-use-web/) &mdash; Provides stories of people with disabilities using the Web; describes types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* [Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)](/perspective-videos/) &mdash; Is a series of 1-minute videos that demonstrate that web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. They show accessibility features, how they impact people with disabilities, and how they benefit everyone in a variety of situations.
* [WAI Web Accessibility Tutorials (Images)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images) &mdash; Shows how to develop web content that is accessible to people with disabilities, and that provides a better user experience for everyone
* WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [ARIA can both cloak and enhance](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices#principle-2-aria-can-both-cloak-and-enhance-creating-both-power-and-danger) section &mdash; provides readers with an understanding of how to use WAI-ARIA to create accessible rich internet applications. 
* HTML5 Specification's [3.2.1 Semantics](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#semantics-2) &mdash;
* [WCAG Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-content) &mdash; All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.
* [WCAG Success Criterion 1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#images-of-text) &mdash; If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text.
