## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This curriculum focuses on markup and coding techniques to develop accessible content. It is designed for any students who are developers or who are in the process of becoming a developer, with special focus on front-end developing techniques.

Its aims are to:

* Explain some key terms of accessibility from a developers' perspective.
* Provide guidance about making several web components accessible for:
  * Keyboard-only users.
  * Screen reader users.
  * Users of magnification.
  * High contrast users.
  * Users with mobility impairments.
  * Users with hearing disabilities.
  * Users with cognitive disabilities.
  
These modules follow a universal design approach. They provide advice on a component basis for different types of scenarios and users.
