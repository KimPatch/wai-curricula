## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This curriculum focuses on markup and coding techniques to develop accessible content. It is designed for teaching developers, with particular focus on front-end developing techniques. Other curricula will address specific techniques for teaching other roles, for example, content authors, project managers, and accessibility testers.

This curriculum makes extensive use of screen readers to both illustrate and test accessibility features. The coding techniques relied upon by screen readers are also relied upon by other assistive technologies, such as voice navigation, switch control, or magnification.

This curriculum results in courses that:

* Explain some key terms of accessibility from a developer's perspective.
* Provide markup and code techniques to make the following accessible:
  * Page structure.
  * Navigation.
  * Images and graphics.
  * Tables.
  * Forms.

## Prerequisites for Students

Students of courses based on this curriculum are expected to have achieved the learning outcomes from the following prior modules and topics:

* [(Introduction to Web accessibility) Module 1: What is Web accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/curricula/introduction-to-web-accessibility/what-is-web-accessibility/) &mdash; Introduces stories of people with disabilities, defines and scopes web accessibility, and introduces its interrelations with other disciplines.
* [(Introduction to Web accessibility) Module 2: People and Digital Technology](/curricula/introduction-to-web-accessibility/people-and-digital-technology/) &mdash; Introduces some accessibility features and barriers, presents some adaptive strategies and assistive tools, and introduces the components of web accessibility.
* [(Introduction to Web accessibility) Module 4: Principles, Standards, and Checks](/curricula/introduction-to-web-accessibility/principles-standards-and-checks/) &mdash; Introduces the principles of web accessibility, as well as the international W3C accessibility standards, and how these are developed. Provides hands-on experience checking how web pages have implemented the standards or not.
* accessibility(https://www.w3.org/WAI/curricula/introduction-to-web-accessibility/getting-started-with-accessibility/#topic-roles-and-responsibilities) &mdash; Introduces roles and responsibilities for accessibility.
