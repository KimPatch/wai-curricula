## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This curriculum focuses on markup and coding techniques to develop accessible content. It is designed for teaching developers, with particular focus on front-end developing techniques. Other curricula addresses teaching designers, content authors, and others.

This curriculum relates primarily to compatibility with text-to-speech functionality, which is used by many people with different types of disabilities.

This curriculum results in courses that:

* Explain some key terms of accessibility from a developer's perspective.
* Provide markup and code techniques to make the following accessible:
  * Page structure.
  * Navigation.
  * Images and graphics.
  * Tables.
  * Forms.
