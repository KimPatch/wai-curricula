* Introduce techniques to create accessible menus and navigational elements.
* Provide guidance in how to make images accessible.
* Provide code-based examples about how to properly associate table headers with their corresponding data cells.
* Provide guidance in how to make forms accessible.
* Introduce strategies that help to make complex widgets such as carousels or accordions accessible.
* Provide tips to test regularly all throughout the development process.
