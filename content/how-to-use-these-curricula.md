## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This page provides further guidance on how to use the materials of the WAI Curricula. It:

* explains how several terms are used
* presents several implementation examples
* discusses some course characteristics that you may want to consider when comparing, selecting, or procuring courses on web accessibility

## Terms Used in these Pages

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Curricula
: refers to the resource as a whole. It comprises each of the curriculum, together with its modules and topics

Curriculum
: a complete part of the curricula addressing one role

Each curriculum contains:

Modules
: smallest logical entity of a curriculum that is expected to be taught and assessed in its entirety. You can teach a whole curriculum on its own or you can select specific modules to cover specific roles together

Topics
: thematic gathering of objectives within a module. These are not necessarily taught in a specific order, neither they are advised to be taught independently of the module they belong to.

Each module defines:

Learning Outcomes
: what students will learn and should be able to demonstrate. This is the core of the curricula

Competencies
: skills or knowledge that students and instructors should have before taking or teaching courses based on these modules.

Teaching Ideas
: suggested ideas to help instructors teach the learning outcomes.

Ideas to Assess Knowledge
: suggested ideas to help instructors assess the skills or knowledge acquired by the students.

Teaching Resources
: recommended resources to deliver the learning outcomes. Some resources are integral part of the teaching while others are optional further reading.

## Implementation Examples

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The following are implementation examples of curricula modules. Some of them are based on a complete curriculum, others combine different curricula modules to address several roles together.

### Introduction to Web Accessibility Course

An introductory course for those roles who want to get started with web accessibility, based on all modules from curriculum [Introduction to web accessibility](/curricula/introduction-to-web-accessibility). It provides level of detail based on roles.

### Introduction to Web Accessibility in a University ICT Program

A university wants to include accessibility in their HCI programs. The below shows how many ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System) an introduction to web accessibility course could take. One ECTS credit corresponds to 25-30 hours of students' workload. 60 credits reflect a complete year of students' workload.

## Compare, Select, and Procure Courses on Web Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The following is a list of course characteristics that you can consider to compare and select courses based on the [WAI Curricula](/curricula/).

### Students' Outcomes

Learning outcomes are usually defined as what a student should be able to demonstrate after completion of a particular course.

Ask for mappings that demonstrate how the course addresses learning outcomes in the curricula. The course does not need to follow the specific order in which learning outcomes are outlined. However, it is advisable that:

* those at a module level are covered
* those from the introductory modules are addressed before any others from specific roles
* those related to how people with disabilities use the Web are part of the course

### Teaching Abilities

Focus on how the course provider plans to teach the learning outcomes. Ask for demonstrations of the strategies used by the instructors and the materials used for the course.

* Will the teaching be face-to-face?
* Will the course be conducted completely online?
* Will teaching strategies include practical interactions with the knowledge covered?
* Will such strategies include interaction with assistive technologies and people with disabilities?

### Assessment

Focus on how the provider plans to assess knowledge. Ask for specific activities and their expected outcomes, as well as for rating systems (if any). There should be at least one assessment per learning outcome. 

### Course Accreditation

Ask if the provider offers any accreditations after course completion. For example, course certificates or free choice subject credits. There are several examples of such accreditation systems, some of which are specific to accessibility.

### Availability of Materials

Ask the provider how they will make materials available to you (online/offline, permanent/temporary consumption). Communicate if you need to keep the slides and/or handouts for future consultation in advance, as some providers may give you a temporary access to their course platforms.

### Specific Audience Needs

Make sure the course provider will cover requirements from all your participants: accessibility needs, cultural preferences. For an understanding of how to make presentations, meetings, talks, and training accessible, refer to [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All](/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/).

### Legal Requirements

Sometimes accessibility training helps to comply with a specific regulation. Make sure to include the policy or policies you need to comply with as different policies may imply different requirements or prioritization of these requirements. For information about international accessibility laws and policies, see [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](/policies/).
