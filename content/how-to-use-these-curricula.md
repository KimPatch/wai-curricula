## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This page provides further guidance about the WAI Curricula. It:

* explains its intended uses
* defines its structure and terminology
* provides implementation examples
* points to course characteristics to consider when comparing, selecting, or procuring courses and/or certification programs on web accessibility

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" open="true" %}

## Uses

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The following are intended use cases for the WAI Curricula:

* faculty staff teaching computer science students about accessibility
* accessibility professionals creating their own courses
* HR professionals comparing between different course and/or certification programs on web accessibility
* procurers putting together an RFP for a course on web accessibility

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

## Structure and Terminology

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The curricula is divided into different parts following a modular approach. Modules of different curricula can be combined to address the needs of several roles together. The introductory curriculum  addresses a variety of roles, and subsequent curricula address specific roles. Each curriculum consists of:

* Prerequisites &mdash; Recommended prior skills or knowledge for students and instructors.
* Modules &mdash; Smallest logical entity of a curriculum that is expected to be taught and assessed in its entirety. They provide advice for different components, scenarios, and users following a universal design approach. Each module consists of:
  * Learning Outcomes for Module &mdash; Overall description of what students will learn and should be able to demonstrate.
  * Competencies &mdash; Recommended prior skills or knowledge for students and instructors.
  * Topics to Teach &mdash; Structured thematic guidance for a consistent teaching sequence.
  * Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module &mdash; Suggested ideas to assess the acquired skills or knowledge based on module contents.
  * Teaching Resources &mdash; Recommended resources to deliver the learning outcomes. Some resources are integral part of the teaching while others are optional further reading.
  * Topics &mdash; Thematic gathering of objectives within a module. these do not need to be taught in order or as classes, but all are recommended for a consistent teaching sequence. Each  topic consists of:
    * Learning Outcomes for Topic &mdash; Detailed description of what students will learn and should be able to demonstrate.
    * Teaching Ideas for Topic &mdash; Suggested ideas to help instructors teach the learning outcomes based on topic contents.
    * Ideas to assess knowledge for Topic &mdash; Suggested ideas to assess the acquired skills or knowledge based on topic contents.

For explanations about specific terminology related to people with disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies, refer to [How people with disabilities use the Web](/people-use-web).

## Implementation Examples

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The following are implementation examples of curricula modules and topics. They are based on roles to address. They provide two levels of detail: essential and complementary, as well as estimates of how many hours each of these levels of detail could take [TBD].

## Course Characteristics

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The following course characteristics can help you compare and select courses and/or certification programs on web accessibility.

### Students' Outcomes

Learning outcomes are usually defined as what a student should be able to demonstrate after completion of a particular course.

You may want to ask for mappings that demonstrate how the course addresses curricula learning outcomes. The course does not need to follow the specific order in which learning outcomes are outlined. However, it is advisable that:

* those at a module level are covered
* those from the introductory modules are addressed before any others from specific roles
* those related to how people with disabilities use the Web are part of the course

### Teaching Abilities

* Will the course be conducted completely online?
* Will teaching strategies include practical interactions with the knowledge covered?
* Will such strategies include interaction with assistive technologies and people with disabilities?

### Assessment Methodology

Focus on how the provider plans to assess knowledge. Ask for specific activities and their expected outcomes, as well as for rating systems (if any). There should be at least one assessment per learning outcome. 

### Accreditation of Course Completion

Course providers may offer any accreditations after course completion. For example, course certificates or free choice subject credits.

### Certification Programs

Competencies and skills on these curricula can be used to create custom mappings for possible certification programs, or to compare with existing ones.

### Specific Audience Needs

For an understanding of how to make presentations, meetings, talks, and training accessible, refer to [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All](/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/).

### Legal Requirements

Sometimes accessibility training helps to comply with a specific regulation. Make sure to include the policy or policies you need to comply with in your RFP> Different policies may imply different requirements or prioritization of such requirements. For information about international accessibility laws and policies, see [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](/policies/).
