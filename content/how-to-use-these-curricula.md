## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This page provides further guidance about the WAI Curricula. It:

* explains its intended uses
* defines its structure and terminology
* provides implementation examples
* points to course characteristics to consider when comparing, selecting, or procuring courses on web accessibility

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" open="true" %}

## Uses

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The curricula can be used in the following scenarios:

* faculty staff teaching computer science students about accessibility
* accessibility consultants creating its own course on web accessibility
* HR professionals comparing between different course and certification programs

You can combine different curricula modules to address the needs of several roles together.

You can also use these curricula to compare different courses and certifications.

These modules follow a universal design approach. They provide advice for different components, scenarios, and users.

## Structure and Terminology

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The curricula is divided into different parts following a modular approach. It consists of:

* Curriculum &mdash; A complete part of the curricula. The introductory part addresses a variety of roles, and subsequent parts address specific roles. Each curriculum contains:
  * Prerequisites &mdash; Recommended prior skills or knowledge.
* Modules &mdash; Smallest logical entity of a curriculum that is expected to be taught and assessed in its entirety. Each module consists of:
  * Learning Outcomes for Module &mdash; Overall description of what students will learn and should be able to demonstrate.
  * Competencies &mdash; Recommended prioir skills or knowledge.
  * Topics to Teach &mdash; Structured thematic guidance to support the teaching sequence.
  * Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module &mdash; Suggested ideas to assess the acquired skills or knowledge based on module contents.
  * Teaching Resources &mdash; Recommended resources to deliver the learning outcomes. Some resources are integral part of the teaching while others are optional further reading.
* Topics &mdash; Thematic gathering of objectives within a module. Each  topic consists of:
  * Learning Outcomes for Topic &mdash; Detailed description of what students will learn and should be able to demonstrate.
  * Teaching Ideas for Topic &mdash; Suggested ideas to help instructors teach the learning outcomes based on topic contents.
  * Ideas to assess knowledge for Topic &mdash; Suggested ideas to assess the acquired skills or knowledge based on topic contents.

For explanations about specific terminology related to people with disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies, refer to [How people with disabilities use the Web](/people-use-web).

## Implementation Examples

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The following are implementation examples of curricula modules. They are based on roles to address. They provide two levels of detail: essential and complementary, as well as hints of how many hours each of these levels of detail could take.

## Compare, Select, and Procure Courses on Web Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The following is a list of course characteristics that you can consider to compare and select courses based on the WAI Curricula.

### Students' Outcomes

Learning outcomes are usually defined as what a student should be able to demonstrate after completion of a particular course.

Ask for mappings that demonstrate how the course addresses learning outcomes in the curricula. The course does not need to follow the specific order in which learning outcomes are outlined. However, it is advisable that:

* those at a module level are covered
* those from the introductory modules are addressed before any others from specific roles
* those related to how people with disabilities use the Web are part of the course

### Teaching Abilities

Focus on how the course provider plans to teach the learning outcomes. Ask for demonstrations of the strategies used by the instructors and the materials used for the course.

* Will the teaching be face-to-face?
* Will the course be conducted completely online?
* Will teaching strategies include practical interactions with the knowledge covered?
* Will such strategies include interaction with assistive technologies and people with disabilities?

### Assessment

Focus on how the provider plans to assess knowledge. Ask for specific activities and their expected outcomes, as well as for rating systems (if any). There should be at least one assessment per learning outcome. 

### Course Accreditation

Ask if the provider offers any accreditations after course completion. For example, course certificates or free choice subject credits. There are several examples of such accreditation systems, some of which are specific to accessibility.

### Availability of Materials

Ask the provider how they will make materials available to you (online/offline, permanent/temporary consumption). Communicate if you need to keep the slides and/or handouts for future consultation in advance, as some providers may give you a temporary access to their course platforms.

### Specific Audience Needs

Make sure the course provider will cover requirements from all your participants: accessibility needs, cultural preferences. For an understanding of how to make presentations, meetings, talks, and training accessible, refer to [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All](/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/).

### Legal Requirements

Sometimes accessibility training helps to comply with a specific regulation. Make sure to include the policy or policies you need to comply with as different policies may imply different requirements or prioritization of these requirements. For information about international accessibility laws and policies, see [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](/policies/).
