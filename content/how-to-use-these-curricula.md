## Comparing Courses

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Curricula sections outlined above can help you compare courses and/or certification programs.

### Learning Outcomes

Learning outcomes are what a student should know or should be able to demonstrate after completion of a particular course.

Courses do not need to follow the specific order in which learning outcomes are outlined. However, it is advisable that:

* those at a module level are covered
* those from the introductory modules are addressed before others from detailed modules
* those related to how people with disabilities use the Web are part of the course

### Teaching Ideas

Ask the provider for demonstrations of the strategies used by the instructors and the materials used for the course. Some of these aspects include:

* delivery: face-to-face, online, blended
* setting: formal, vocational
* approach: theoretical, practical, both
* interaction with assistive technologies and adaptive strategies

### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Focus on outcomes from the proposed assessment, as well as on rating systems (if any). Each learning outcome should have at least one assessment.

### Accreditation on Course Completion

Course providers may offer any accreditations after course completion. For example, course certificates or free choice subject credits.

### Certification Programs

You can use competencies and skills on these curricula to compare or create custom mappings for certification programs.

### Availability of Materials

Communicate how you would like to receive the materials and if you want to be able to acces them after the course has ended. Providers can make materials available to you in a variety of ways:

* online / offline
* permanently / temporarily
* digital / analog

### Specific Audience Needs

The course provider should cover requirements from all your participants: accessibility needs, cultural preferences. For an understanding of how to make presentations, meetings, talks, and training accessible, refer to [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All](/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/).

### Legal Requirements

Sometimes accessibility training helps to comply with a specific regulation. Make sure to include the policy or policies you need to comply with in your RFP. Different policies may imply different requirements or prioritization of such requirements. For information about international accessibility laws and policies, see [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](/policies/).
