## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This resource provides a set of role-based curricula to help you create courses on web [(Introduction to Web Accessibility) Roles and Responsibilities]. It defines learning outcomes, and provides ideas to teach and assess knowledge.

## Uses

You can use these curricula in different contexts, including:

* Online and in-class teaching
* Formal and informal teaching
* Guided and non-guided teaching
* Academic and vocational education

You can also use these curricula to compare different course offerings.

## Structure

Each curriculum contains:

* Modules &mdash; Smallest logical entity of a curriculum that is expected to be taught and assessed in its entirety.
* Topics &mdash; Thematic gathering of objectives within a module, which are not necessarily taught in a specific order.

The curricula define:

* Learning Outcomes &mdash; What students will learn and should be able to demonstrate. This is the core of the curricula.
* Teaching Ideas &mdash; Suggested ideas to help instructors teach the learning outcomes.
* Ideas to Assess Knowledge &mdash; Suggested ideas to help instructors assess the knowledge acquired by the students.
* Teaching Resources &mdash; Recommended resources to deliver the learning outcomes. Some resources are integral part of the teaching while others are optional further reading.

Each curriculum also specifies competencies that students are expected to have prior to taking a course, and the competences that instructors are expected to have to deliver it.

## Future Outline

The table below shows ideas for future curricula. When completed, they will be linked from here. Currently only the first curriculum "Introduction to Web [(Introduction to Web Accessibility) Roles and Responsibilities]" is available.
