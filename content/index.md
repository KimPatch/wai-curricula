## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This resource provides a set of role-based curricula to help you create courses on web accessibility. It defines learning outcomes, and provides ideas to teach and assess knowledge.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

## Uses

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Curricula uses include:

* faculty staff teache computer science students about accessibility
* accessibility professionals create their own courses
* HR professionals compare between different course and/or certification programs on web accessibility
* procurers put together an RFP for a course on web accessibility

## Structure and Terminology

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The curricula are divided into different parts following a modular approach. Modules of different curricula can be combined to address the needs of several roles together. The introductory curriculum  addresses a variety of roles, and subsequent curricula address specific roles. Each curriculum consists of:

* Prerequisites &mdash; Recommended prior skills or knowledge for students and instructors.
* Modules &mdash; Smallest logical entity of a curriculum that is expected to be taught and assessed in its entirety. They provide advice for different components, scenarios, and users following a universal design approach. Each module consists of:
  * Learning Outcomes for Module &mdash; Overall description of what students will learn and should be able to demonstrate.
  * Competencies &mdash; Recommended prior skills or knowledge for students and instructors.
  * Topics to Teach &mdash; Structured thematic guidance for a consistent teaching sequence.
  * Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module &mdash; Suggested ideas to assess the acquired skills or knowledge based on module contents.
  * Teaching Resources &mdash; Recommended resources to deliver the learning outcomes. Some resources are integral part of the teaching while others are optional further reading.
  * Topics &mdash; Thematic gathering of objectives within a module. These do not need to be taught in order or as classes, but all are recommended for a consistent teaching sequence. Each  topic consists of:
    * Learning Outcomes for Topic &mdash; Detailed description of what students will learn and should be able to demonstrate.
    * Teaching Ideas for Topic &mdash; Suggested ideas to help instructors teach the learning outcomes based on topic contents.
    * Ideas to assess knowledge for Topic &mdash; Suggested ideas to assess the acquired skills or knowledge based on topic contents.

For explanations about specific terminology related to people with disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies, refer to [How people with disabilities use the Web](/people-use-web).
