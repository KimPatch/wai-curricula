## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This resource provides a set of role-based curricula to help you create courses on web accessibility. It defines learning outcomes, and provides ideas to teach and assess knowledge.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

## Uses

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Curricula uses include:

* faculty staff teach computer science students about accessibility
* accessibility professionals create their own courses
* HR professionals compare between different course and/or certification programs on web accessibility
* procurers put together an RFP for a course on web accessibility

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

## Structure and Terminology

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The curricula are divided into different parts following a modular approach. Modules of different curricula can be combined to address the needs of several roles together. The introductory curriculum  addresses a variety of roles, and subsequent curricula address specific roles. Each curriculum consists of:

* Prerequisites &mdash; Recommended prior skills or knowledge for students and instructors.
* Modules &mdash; Smallest logical entity of a curriculum that is expected to be taught and assessed in its entirety. They provide advice for different components, scenarios, and users following a universal design approach. Each module consists of:
  * Learning Outcomes for Module &mdash; Overall description of what students will learn and should be able to demonstrate.
  * Competencies &mdash; Recommended prior skills or knowledge for students and instructors.
  * Topics to Teach &mdash; Structured thematic guidance for a consistent teaching sequence.
  * Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module &mdash; Suggested ideas to assess the acquired skills or knowledge based on module contents.
  * Teaching Resources &mdash; Recommended resources to deliver the learning outcomes. Some resources are integral part of the teaching while others are optional further reading.
  * Topics &mdash; Thematic gathering of objectives within a module. These do not need to be taught in order or as classes, but all are recommended for a consistent teaching sequence. Each  topic consists of:
    * Learning Outcomes for Topic &mdash; Detailed description of what students will learn and should be able to demonstrate.
    * Teaching Ideas for Topic &mdash; Suggested ideas to help instructors teach the learning outcomes based on topic contents.
    * Ideas to assess knowledge for Topic &mdash; Suggested ideas to assess the acquired skills or knowledge based on topic contents.

For explanations about specific terminology related to people with disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies, refer to [How people with disabilities use the Web](/people-use-web).

## Comparing Courses

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Curricula [Structure and Terminology](#structure-and-terminology) can help you compare courses and/or certification programs.

### Learning Outcomes

Learning outcomes are what a student should know or should be able to demonstrate after completion of a particular course.

Courses do not need to follow the specific order in which learning outcomes are outlined. However, it is advisable that:

* those at a module level are covered
* those from the introductory modules are addressed before others from detailed modules
* those related to how people with disabilities use the Web are part of the course

### Teaching Ideas

Ask the provider for demonstrations of the strategies used by the instructors and the materials used for the course. Some of these aspects include:

delivery
: face-to-face, online, blended

setting
: formal, vocational

approach
: theoretical, practical, both

interaction with assistive technologies and adaptive strategies
: hands-on experience, live demonstrations, multimedia (video and/or audio) demonstrations
{:.notbold}

### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Focus on outcomes from the proposed assessment, as well as on rating systems (if any). Each learning outcome should have at least one assessment.

### Accreditation on Course Completion

Course providers may offer any accreditations after course completion. For example, course certificates or free choice subject credits.

### Certification Programs

You can use competencies and skills on these curricula to compare or create custom mappings for certification programs.

### Availability of Materials

Communicate how you would like to receive the materials and if you want to be able to access them after the course has ended. Providers can make materials available to you in a variety of ways:

interaction
: online / offline

access rights
: permanently / temporarily

format
: digital / analog
{:.notbold}

### Specific Audience Needs

The course provider should cover requirements from all your participants: accessibility needs, cultural preferences. For an understanding of how to make presentations, meetings, talks, and training accessible, refer to [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All](/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/).

### Legal Requirements

Sometimes accessibility training helps to comply with a specific regulation. Make sure to include the policy or policies you need to comply with in your RFP. Different policies may imply different requirements or prioritization of such requirements. For information about international accessibility laws and policies, see [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](/policies/).
