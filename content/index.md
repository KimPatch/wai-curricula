## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This resource provides a set of role-based curricula to help you compare and create courses on web accessibility. It defines learning outcomes, and provides ideas to teach and assess knowledge.

## Creating Courses

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

The curricula has different sets of modules. These sets can be combined to address the needs of several roles together. The introductory modules address all roles, and subsequent sets address specific roles. Each set consists of:

### Prerequisites

Recommended prior skills or knowledge for students and instructors.

 ### Modules
  
These provide advice for different components, scenarios, and users following a universal design approach. You should teach and assess each module in its entirety. Each module consists of:

#### Learning Outcomes for Module

Overall description of what students will learn and should be able to demonstrate. These are the core of the resource. You should make sure to reflect all of them in your course.

#### Competencies

Recommended prior skills for students and instructors. Some modules require little skills. Other do require skills  delivered in previous modules. Your courses should be consistent with each of the skills outlined in the modules you plan to use.

#### Topics to Teach

Structured thematic guidance to build your teaching sequence. You do not need to teach topics in order or as classes, but all are necessary to achieve the learning outcomes. Each topic consists of:

* Learning Outcomes for Topic &mdash; Description of what students will learn and should be able to demonstrate.
* Teaching Ideas for Topic &mdash; Suggested ideas to help instructors teach the learning outcomes based on topic contents.
* Ideas to assess knowledge for Topic &mdash; Suggested ideas to assess the acquired skills or knowledge based on topic contents.

For explanations about specific terminology related to people with disabilities, abilities, barriers, tools, and techniques, refer to [How people with disabilities use the Web](/people-use-web).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Suggested ideas to assess the acquired skills or knowledge based on module contents.

#### Teaching Resources

Recommended resources to deliver the learning outcomes. Some resources are integral part of the teaching while others are optional further reading.

## Comparing Courses

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Curricula [Creating Courses](#creating-courses) helps you understand the meaning of the different curricula sections. You can also use these sections to compare courses and/or certification programs.

### Learning Outcomes

Courses do not need to follow the specific order in which learning outcomes are outlined. However, we recommend that providers:

* cover at least those at a module level
* address those from the introductory modules before others from detailed modules
* make those related to how people with disabilities use the Web an integral part of the course

### Teaching Ideas

Focus on the instructor's strategies and on the materials used for the course. Some of these strategies include:

* delivery &mdash; face-to-face, online, blended learning
* setting &mdash; formal, vocational
* approach &mdash; theoretical, practical, both
* interaction with assistive technologies and adaptive strategies &mdash; hands-on experience, live demonstrations, multimedia (video and/or audio) demonstrations

### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Focus on outcomes from the proposed assessment, as well as on rating systems (if any). Each learning outcome should have at least one assessment.

### Accreditation on Course Completion

Focus on any accreditations after course completion that providers may offer. For example, course certificates or free choice subject credits.

### Certification Programs

You can use competencies and skills on these curricula to compare or create custom mappings for certification programs.

### Availability of Materials

Focus on how you would like to receive the materials and on how loog you need to keep them after the course has ended. Providers can make materials available to you in a variety of ways, such as:

* access rights &mdash; permanently / temporarily
* interaction &mdash; online / offline
* format &mdash; digital / analog

### Specific Audience Needs

The course provider needs to cover requirements from all your participants: accessibility needs, cultural preferences. For an understanding of how to make presentations, meetings, talks, and training accessible, refer to [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All](/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/).

### Legal Requirements

Sometimes accessibility training helps to comply with a specific regulation. Make sure to include the policy or policies you need to comply with in your RFP. Different policies may imply different requirements or prioritization of such requirements. For information about international accessibility laws and policies, see [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](/policies/).
