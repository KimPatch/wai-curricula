## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This resource provides a set of role-based curricula to help you create 
courses on web accessibility. It defines learning outcomes, and provides 
ideas to teach and assess knowledge.

## Uses

You can use these curricula in different contexts, including:
* Online and in-class teaching
* Formal and informal teaching
* Guided and non-guided teaching
* Academic and vocational education

You can also use these curricula to compare different course offerings.

## Structure

Each curriculum contains:
* Modules &mdash; Smallest logical entity of a curriculum that is expected to 
be taught and assessed in its entirety.
* Topics &mdash; Thematic gathering of objectives within a module, which are 
not necessarily taught in this grouping.

The curricula define:
* Learning Outcomes &mdash; What students will learn and should be 
able to demonstrate. This is the core of the curricula.
* Teaching Ideas &mdash; Suggested ideas to help instructors teach the 
learning outcomes.
* Ideas to Assess Knowledge &mdash; Suggested ideas to help instructors assess 
the knowledge acquired by the students.
* Teaching Resources &mdash; Recommended resources to deliver the learning 
outcomes. Some resources are integral part of the teaching while others 
are optional further reading.

Each curriculum also specifies competencies that students are expected 
to have prior to taking a course, and the competences that instructors 
are expected to have to deliver it.

## Future Outline

The table below shows how this resource could address different roles. 
Currently only the first curriculum "Introduction to Web Accessibility" 
is available. Other curricula will follow, and will be linked from here.
