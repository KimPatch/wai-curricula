Ask students to reflect on their experiences.
* Explain how different [(Introduction to Web Accessibility) Roles and Responsibilities] features and barriers affect use of the content with assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. For an introduction to certain assistive tools and adaptive strategies, refer to [Tools and Techniques](/people-use-web/tools-techniques/).

**Important:**
* Emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even when those users have the same type of disability.
* For information on avoiding clich√©s and myths, see [Interacting with People with Disabilities {% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/interact.html).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practice &mdash; Students explore the use of assistive technologies to perform a task, such as reading the news, making a purchase, or interacting in social networks. Assess students' capacity to understand how the assistive technology functions and interact with it.
* Presentation &mdash; Students present digital life and most important use cases for a particular type of disability they are interested in. Assess students' capacity to reflect on the benefits of computers and the Web for people with disabilities.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students research about how technology helped popular people with disabilities in their daily lives. Examples: Frida Kahlo, Stephen Hawking, or Stevie Wonder. Assess students' capacity to identify how people with disabilities use technology.
