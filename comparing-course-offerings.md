## Introduction

This page provides further guidance on how to compare and select course offerings using the materials of the WAI-Curricula. It underlines key points that might be taken into account when analyzing course offerings to select the ones that best suit your needs.

## Comparing Course Offerings

* Learning Outcomes -- First, ask for mappings that demonstrate how the course addresses learning outcomes in the curricula. It is not necessary that the course follows the learning outcomes exactly as they are outlined in the curricula modules, but it is advisable that at least those at a unit level are properly covered.
* Teaching Ideas -- Focus on how the course offerer plans to teach the learning outcomes. Ask for demonstrations of teaching abilities of the instructors or the materials used for the course if it is a MOOC.
* Ideas to Assess Knowledge -- Focus on how the course offerer plans to assess knowledge. Ask for possible certifications on course completion and for specific activities that are proposed in the course.
* Availability of materials -- Ask the course offerer how they will make materials available to you, if they are going to let you keep the slides and/or handouts.
