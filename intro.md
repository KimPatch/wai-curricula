**Note**: This is a suggested teaching outline to help achieve the learning outcomes. Instructors might choose to adapt the sequence of the lessons or their content according to the particular audience and context.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

#### Lesson 1: Stories of people with disabilities

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Provide tangible examples of people with disabilities using the Web. If possible, invite real users to demonstrate how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to interact with the Web. If it is not possible to bring in real people with disabilities, consider using video recordings. If video cannot be used either, use images and story-telling techniques to help illustrate realistic personas and user stories, such as those provided in the teaching materials.

As you may only have time for one or two examples, make sure to emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even with the same type of disability. Also emphasize how design features can enable or disable people. That is, emphasize the social model of disability and avoid using a medical approach. Avoid frequently encountered clichés and myths. Complement the few examples that you cover in-depth with some examples of people with other types of disabilities.

**Tip:** Commonly it is helpful to show examples of people using accessible content first, so that students realize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.

**Note:** Later lessons will introduce different types of disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies in more depth. This lesson is primarily intended for firsthand experience of real people, which is often first encounter for students.

##### Learning outcomes

  * Understanding how some individuals with disabilities use the Web.
  * Appreciating the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.
  * Gaining empathy, inspiration, and motivation for the topic.

##### Approximate duration.

1-2 hours, depending on demonstrations and activities.

##### Suggested teaching methods 

* **Demonstrations**: Invite people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies - this is often the first encounter for students to observe real use of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.
* **Conversational**: Invite people with disabilities for a discussion on their daily experience while using the Web - this is often the first opportunity for students to engage with people with disabilities and to build more empathy.
* **Experiential**: Ask students to try out using assistive technologies as demonstrated by experienced users - this can be a fun way to get an understanding and appreciations for different ways of interacting with the Web.

##### Suggested activities 

Ask students to try and follow along an experienced user using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. For example, using text to speech, speech recognition, and other accessibility features built into their mobile phones.

##### Suggested homework 

Ask students to reflect on their observations, for example in a short essay (200-300 words). Students should explain some of the design features that one of the assistive technologies they learned about relies on to function.

##### Suggested teaching materials

  * <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/">Stories of web users</a>

#### Lesson 2: Diverse abilities, tools, and barriers
 
{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 
 
Introduce examples of specific types of disabilities, including people with auditory, cognitive and learning, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Introduce some of the design and implementation barriers that people encounter. Relate some of these barriers to personal experiences in using the Web, such as being overwhelmed by the content or confused by the navigation etc. Emphasize how every individual is unique.

**Tip**: As this lesson might become too medical at a first approach, focus on the fact that barriers are not caused by the disability itself but, instead, by bad implementations at a software or product level.

##### Learning outcomes

* Knowledge about the different types of disabilities.
* Awareness on the most common implementation barriers.
* Knowledge about how to relate such barriers with personal experiences of people with disabilities.

##### Approximate duration

1 hour.

### Ideas for Assessment

  * **Knowledge Questions** &mdash; Learners should be able to explain different business case arguments for digital accessibility, and broader benefits of accessibility for people in different situations and contexts.
  * **Presentations** &mdash; Learners should be able to develop potential business case arguments for their own organization, and present this to other learners as examples of how they can apply what they have learned.

### Notes

  * **Cultural aspects** &mdash; The cultural acceptance and approach to accessibility and disability varies between countries and even individual organizations. The business case arguments may need to be adjusted accordingly.
  * **Business context** &mdash; The business context that learners are used to may also require adjustment of the business case arguments. For example, to better relate to their industry sector and organizational culture.
