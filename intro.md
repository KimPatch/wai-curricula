* Lesson 4 "Principles of inclusive design": explains the basic principles of inclusive design, to address people with different accessibility needs, temporary and situational limitations, and other benefits.

**Note**: This is a suggested teaching outline to help achieve the learning outcomes. Instructors might choose to adapt the sequence of the lessons or their content according to the particular audience and context.

{% include_cached excol.html type="all" %}

{% include_cached excol.html type="start" %}

#### Lesson 1: Stories of people with disabilities

{% include_cached excol.html type="middle" %}

Provide tangible examples of people with disabilities using the Web. If possible, invite real users to demonstrate how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to interact with the Web. If it is not possible to bring in real people with disabilities, consider using video recordings. If video cannot be used either, use images and story-telling techniques to help illustrate realistic personas and user stories, such as those provided in the teaching materials.

As you may only have time for one or two examples, make sure to emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even with the same type of disability. Also emphasize how design features can enable or disable people. That is, emphasize the social model of disability and avoid using a medical approach. Avoid frequently encountered clichés and myths. Complement the few examples that you cover in-depth with some examples of people with other types of disabilities.

**Tip:** Commonly it is helpful to show examples of people using accessible content first, so that students realize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.

**Note:** Later lessons will introduce different types of disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies in more depth. This lesson is primarily intended for first-hand experience of real people, which is often first encounter for students.

##### Learning outcomes

  * Understanding how some individuals with disabilities use the Web.
  * Appreciating the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.
  * Gaining empathy, inspiration, and motivation for the topic.

##### Approximate duration.

1-2 hours, depending on demonstrations and activities.

##### Suggested teaching methods 

* **Demonstrations**: Invite people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies - this is often the first encounter for students to observe real use of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.
* **Conversational**: Invite people with disabilities for a discussion on their daily experience while using the Web - this is often the first opportunity for students to engage with people with disabilities and to build more empathy.
* **Experiential**: Ask students to try out using assistive technologies as demonstrated by experienced users - this can be a fun way to get an understanding and appreciations for different ways of interacting with the Web.

##### Suggested activities 

* Ask students to try and follow along an experienced user using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. For example, using text to speech, speech recognition, and other accessibility features built into their mobile phones.

##### Suggested homework 

* Ask students to reflect on their observations, for example in a short essay (200-300 words). Students should explain some of the design features that one of the assistive technologies they learned about relies on to function.

##### Suggested teaching materials

### Teaching outline

  * **Components of web accessibility** &mdash; Revise the inter-relationship between accessibility features in web technologies such as HTML, in web content, web authoring tools, web browsers, and assistive tools, which were introduced in the first teaching unit of this module. Relate this back to more specific examples for the second teaching module and highlight the broader benefits of these examples. Reiterate that accessibility encompasses many types of roles and responsibilities.
  * **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** &mdash; Introduce the scope of "web content" in WCAG, which includes desktop and mobile websites and applications. Highlight that there are currently two operational versions, 2.0 and 2.1, with 2.0 being a subset of 2.1 that provides improvements for people with cognitive and learning disabilities, people with low vision, and people with disabilities using mobile devices. Refer to the uptake of WCAG in different policies and standards.
  * **Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)** &mdash; Introduce the scope of "authoring tools" in ATAG, which include diverse content production tools including text and graphic based code editing tools, content management systems (CMS), conversion tools, and social media platforms. Emphasize the relevance of authoring tools given the volume of content being generated every day, usually created by non-technical content authors without accessibility expertise.
  * **User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)** &mdash; Introduce the scope of "user agents" in UAAG, which include diverse applications including web browsers, web-based media players, and some types of assistive tools and mobile applications that allow users to access and interact with web content. Emphasize the relevance of user agents, which are key to supporting accessibility features in web technologies and content; lack of accessibility support is a primary barrier.
  * **Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)** &mdash; Explain that this accessibility standard does not define accessibility requirements but rather provides a mechanism for authors to embed semantics in web content, to facilitate interoperability with assistive tools. Emphasize that many of these semantics are meanwhile integrated directly in HTML5, which should be used natively whenever possible. WAI-ARIA can also be used with other technologies, such as SVG.
  * **Open standards development** &mdash; Explain that these W3C accessibility standards and guidelines are developed following an open consensus process, with involvement of representation of people with disabilities, industry, public bodies, research, and individual experts. W3C Working Groups publish working drafts periodically for comments from the public. Everyone is encouraged to comments, to help include many perspectives thus ensure broad consensus around these standards.
  * **Web accessibility principles** &mdash; Explain the terms Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR) based on how they are defined in WCAG. Introduce the Guidelines defined by WCAG for each of these terms, and provide specific examples to help explain the meaning and relevance of each. For example, provide a specific example of the Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable. Emphasize how such requirements are essential for people with disabilities and benefit all.
  * **First checks for web accessibility principles** &mdash; Guide learners through preliminary checks for web accessibility on simple web pages; for example, to identify page headings and their relative order, use by keyboard and other indicative checks (not full conformance evaluation, which requires technical skills and further accessibility knowledge). Ask learners to explore different types of websites and relate their finds to the accessibility principles and guidelines.

### Suggested teaching methods
  **Interactive** &mdash; To make many terms and definitions more tangible, ask learners to provide examples of web content, authoring tools, user agents, and of situations relating to the accessibility guidelines defined by WCAG.
