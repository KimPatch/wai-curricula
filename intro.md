## People and Access Technology ##

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Description</strong></dt>
  <dd>Introduction to how people with disabilities use the Web, different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use, and some of the barriers that people encounter on the Web.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></dt>
  <dd><ul>
    <li>Awareness of diverse types of disabilities and related accessibility needs</li>
    <li>Understanding of different types of design barriers preventing accessibility</li>
    <li>Knowledge about different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies</li>
    <li>Appreciation for overlapping user needs and the principles of universal design</li>
  </ul></dd>
  <dt><strong>Prerequisites for Learners</strong></dt>
  <dd>[Basic] Basic understanding of computers and the Web.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Prerequisites for Trainers</strong></dt>
  <dd>[Advanced] In-depth knowledge of accessibility principles and universal design, and expertise in working with people with different types of disabilities.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Approximate Duration</strong></dt>
  <dd>3-5 hours depending on activities.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Teaching Outline</strong></dt>
  <dd><ul>
    <li><strong>Stories of people with disabilities</strong> &mdash; Provide tangible examples of people with disabilities using the Web. If possible, invite real users to demonstrate how they use the Web. Highlight the diversity of people with disabilities (also within the same medical group), and how they use the Web. Avoid frequently encountered cliches, and emphasize how design and implementation cause barriers as opposed to barriers being inherent to the user (social model of disability).</li>
    <li><strong>Diverse abilities, tools, and barriers</strong> &mdash; Introduce examples of specific types of disabilities, including people with auditory, cognitive and learning, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Introduce some of the design and implementation barriers that people encounter. Relate some of these barriers to personal experiences in using the Web, such as being overwhelmed by the content or confused by the navigation etc. Emphasize how every individual is unique.</li>
    <li><strong>Assistive tools and adaptive strategies</strong> &mdash; Provide an opportunity for learners to experience some types of assistive tools, such as a screen reader, and adaptive strategies, such as changing fonts and colors. Demonstrate use by experienced users of access technology, to avoid misunderstanding of the tools (assistive tools can be very complex and not intended for casual use). Exncourage learners to explore different settings in web browsers and operating systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Principles of universal design</strong> &mdash; Explain the overlapping accessibility needs of different users, such as "reading aloud" functionality benefiting people not seeing the screen and people with some forms of dyslexia. Explain that people could have combinations of disabilities, such as auditory and visual disabilities, especially with growing age. In particular, emphasize the people have very individual combinations of accessibility needs and preferences.</li>
  </ul></dd>
  <dt><strong>Teaching Methods</strong></dt>
  <dd><strong>Experiential</strong> &mdash; Provide opportunity for learners to experience real people and tools. If possible, invite people with disabilities or show videos. Accompanying explanation and guidance is still required.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Teaching Materials</strong></dt>
  <dd><ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> &mdash; provides stories of people with diverse disabilities using the Web; enumerates different types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies that some people use.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/">Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)</a> &mdash; series of 10 videos, each of around 1 minute duration, that highlight different types of accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilites and other users. For example, one video introduces colors with good contrast and how it benefits many people.</li>
  </ul></dd>
  <dt><strong>Assessment Methods</strong></dt>
  <dd><ul>
    <li><strong>Knowledge Questions</strong> &mdash; Learners should be able to explain different types of accessibility features, such as colors with good contrast, types of barriers, and types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies. <br /><em>(Note: focus questions on functional aspects of accessibility rather than on medical conditions of people)</em></li>
    <li><strong>Demonstrations</strong> &mdash; Learners may be able to demonstrate what they have learned from exploring assistive tools and adaptive strategies, such as explaining different settings they found in their web browser.</li>
  </ul></dd>
  <dt><strong>Notes</strong></dt>
  <dd><ul>
    <li><strong>Ethical considerations</strong> &mdash; Consider the appropriate ethical aspects when working with people (also when showing videos of people); for example, ensure consent, provide compensation, and avoid patronizing behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>Cliches and myths</strong> &mdash; Unfortunately there are cliches, myths, and even stigmatization of people with disabilities, which could be unintentionally reinforced with caution. Experienced trainers are recommended.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural apsects</strong> &mdash; The definition of disability and the approach to accessibility varies between different cultures. This can impact the initial level of awareness and acceptance for the topic by learners.</li>
  </ul></dd>

## Business Case and Benefits ##

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Description</strong></dt>
  <dd>Introduction to the business case for web accessibility, including social, technical, finanicial, and legal aspects, as well as the broader benefits of accessibility for most users of the Web.</dd>
