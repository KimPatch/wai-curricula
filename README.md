## Publication Note

NB SL: This no longer appears to be true - check
<br>SLH: I think it is still true. We need to get it documented and decide how we want to address cases like this, and do the same thing across Repos. I think right now we have similar functionality with different repo names for curricula and ACT Rules -- and will be wanting to do something similar for ARIA APG soon... 

This repository has a `production` branch which is referenced in the main `wai-website` repository. Note that for new content to show up on the website the `master` branch need to be merged into `production`.
