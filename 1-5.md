## Ideas for Assessment

* Learners should be able to enumerate different roles and responsibilities involved in web accessibility, and different organizational considerations to plan for and manage implementation.
* Learners should be able to reflect on the capacity and maturity of their own organizations regarding web accessibility with respect to (lack of) accessibility processes and practices put in place.
