This unit introduces resources on how to plan, manage and apply accessibility within organizations. It provides an overview on organizational planning and managing strategies to ensure accessibility is part of the process, and on different roles and responsibilities which have an influence on accessibility implementations. In addition, it emphasizes how involving people with disabilities in the whole design and development process has a positive impact on all users. It also underlines the importance of developing policies on how to implement accessibility and respond in an efficient manner to accessibility/related queries from users.

**TIP** &mdash; The business context that learners are used to may also require adjustment of the suggested considerations and strategies. For example, policies often apply differently to public and private bodies.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

**Presentational** Introduce specific considerations to integrate accessibility throughout the design process. i.e.:
	* Ensuring management commitment to accessibility
	* Assigning appropriate roles and responsibilities
	* Providing technical and financial resources
	* Ensuring accessibility is integrated into Quality Management processes.
**Practical**: 
	* Explain how the capability and maturity of an organization with regard to web accessibility can be assessed based on these considerations.
	* Provide resources about involving real users with disabilities early on in the design process, and throughout the development and maintenance stages of websites.
	* Provide real examples of organizations or companies that have developed a consistent set of accessibility strategies.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

**Presentational**
	* Explain the different types of roles involved in implementing web accessibility
	* Introduce the scope of their responsibilities throughout the design and development process.
	* Explain that everyone involved throughout the design and development process needs to have an adequate level of awareness and skills.
	* Emphasize that accessibility is not only a technical discipline but it also needs to be taken into account as an organizational aspect.

#### Suggested activities

Promote discussion with students around a particular accessibility feature and try to help them identify the specific role within the team who would be in charge of it. Reflect on whether this would be the only role involved or this issue might require help from other team memberrs.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to write some lines on the main accessibility roles and responsibilities they have just been introduced to. Encourage them to put especial attention to the ones they may be more involved in if they work in accessibility.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

**Presentational**: introduce students to current accessibility policies so that they become familiar with their main elements. Elaborate on the fact that there needs to be a commitment on tangible goals and achievements as well as on compliance with the applicable standards and policies (if any). Remember the need of contemplating mechanisms to accommodate smoothly to updates on the standards as they appear.

**Presentational**: Provide information about putting accessibility policies in place:
	* to document organizational commitments
	* to encourage implementation of web accessibility.
**Practical**: If possible, reference publicly available accessibility statements and emphasize:
	* that they help increase the commitment to accessibility
	* that they serve to communicate the efforts undertaken by organizations towards accessibility.
* Introduce some of the strategies that can be used to prioritize issues and pursue interim repairs, which can become necessary when accessibility is not considered from the start of the design and development process.

## Ideas for Assessment

* **Knowledge Questions** &mdash; Learners should be able to enumerate different roles and responsibilities involved in web accessibility, and different organizational considerations to plan for and manage implementation.
* **Reflections** &mdash; Learners should be able to reflect on the capacity and maturity of their own organizations regarding web accessibility with respect to (lack of) accessibility processes and practices put in place.
