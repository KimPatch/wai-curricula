### Lesson 3: Involving people with disabilities throughout

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Provides resources about involving real users with disabilities early on in the design process, and throughout the development and maintenance stages of websites. Emphasize how usability testing with people with disabilities also addresses mainstream audiences as well as people with situational limitations. Explain the ethical considerations required when working with people, including people with disabilities.

**Tip**: Underline the fact that experienced users are preferred since their use of assistive technologies and/or adaptive strategies will be much more confident than that of people who is less experienced. Encourage students  to take time and compensation into account and to respect people with disabilities as they would respect others.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding the need of incorporating people with disabilities into web development and testing
* Awareness that incorporating people with disabilities also helps improve products and services for other users.

### Lesson 4: Developing policies on web accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Provides information about putting accessibility policies in place, to document organizational commitments and to encourage implementation of web accessibility. If possible, publicly available accessibility statements help increase the commitment to accessibility and communicate the efforts undertaken by organizations towards accessibility. Ask learners to reflect on general use of policies at their organization.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding the strategic importance of accessibility policies to ensure and reinforce commitment among the organization members.
* Awareness on some current accessibility commitments from organizations.

#### Approximate duration.

30 minutes.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

**Presentational**: introduce students to current accessibility policies so that they are familiarized with their main elements. Elaborate on the fact that there needs to be a commitment on tangible goals and achievements as well as on current standards and policies, ideally referencing directly those from the W3C and contemplating mechanisms to accommodate smoothly to updates on the standards as they appear.

#### Suggested activities 

Engage students in a conversation about whether or not they are aware of any accessibility statement and encourage them to reflect on some of the aspects they include: current accessibility status of the product, standard to which it needs to be compliant, etc.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to draft an accessibility statement taking into account a particular product of their choice.

### Lesson 5: Responding to accessibility questions

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain the importance of responding to accessibility queries and complaints. Often issues can be addressed more easily than anticipated, and responsiveness demonstrates customer care. Introduce some of the strategies that can be used to prioritize issues and pursue interim repairs, which can become necessary when accessibility is not considered from the start of the design and development process.

**Tip:** Elaborate on how to prioritize issues, addressing first those which have the highest impact in user experience. Comment on how answers and follow-ups are expected from users and that it is not a good practice to leave all the accessibility communications to automatic replies or catch phrases.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding the importance of taking care of accessibility-related inquiries.
* Knowledge of some of the strategies to prioritize issues and pursue interim repairs.
