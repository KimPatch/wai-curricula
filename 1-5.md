### Topic: Planning and Managing Web Accessibility

Select strategies from the [Planning and Managing Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/) resource that best apply to the learners’ situations. Emphasize that it is crucial to have management support to succeed in long term accessibility implementations.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

* Describe some accessibility case studies from organizations

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas 

* Introduce specific considerations to integrate accessibility based on your particular learners. See the [Planning and Managing Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/) resource.
* Emphasize the importance of involving real users with disabilities early, and throughout projects. See the [Involving Users with Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/involving-users/) resource.
* Discuss case studies of organizations and/or campuses that have adopted accessibility. Analyze with students successes and challenges of such cases. See the [Business Case for Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/) resource.
* Engage students in a Start, Stop, Continue exercise to identify processes, tasks, and strategies within their organization for which accessibility implementation may need to be revised. Encourage discussion by bringing in design and development processes, media production, procurement, etc.

#### Homework Ideas

* Provide students with a multiple choice quiz in which they want to select all of the accessibility planning and managing strategies they consider important for their organization. Encourage them to elaborate on how they would integrate new accessibility strategies they might not have known about before.
* Ask students to list various roles in charge of accessibility among the team and which would be their main responsibilities.
* Ask students to pick up a product or service of their choice and to develop strategies to efficiently plan and manage accessibility. Encourage them to think about key roles and responsibilities as well as key actions that need to be taken to ensure that accessibility is maintained throughout time.
* Ask students to research for accessibility systems in their campus, and to find out which policies have been followed to achieve accessibility.

### Topic: Developing Policies and Statements

Introduce students to accessibility policies for organizations and accessibility statements for websites. See the [Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies) and the [Developing an Accessibility Statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/) resources. Emphasize that policies are mostly internal within organizations, whereas statements are public commitments on accessibility implementation.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:

* Describe accessibility policies as a mechanism to reinforce commitment among the organization members
* Recognize the role of accessibility statements as a way of documenting the current status of accessibility and of defining future steps and commitments
* Explain some current accessibility approaches from well-known organizations and campuses  

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* If possible, bring in some examples of accessibility policies you are aware of or may have access to. Explain that they serve to document organizational commitments, to encourage implementation, and to define processes. If you don't have such documents, refer to the [Accessibility Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies) resource, and walk students through the different elements that are needed for an effective accessibility policy.
* Ask students to explore publicly-available accessibility statements and encourage them to reflect on some of the aspects they include.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to draft an accessibility policy based on a particular organization of their choice. Ask them to define the scope of the policy, to reference current standards, and to set compliance levels. Use the [Accessibility Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies) resource as a reference.
* Ask students to draft an accessibility statement for a product of their choice. Show the [Developing an Accessibility Statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/) resource as a reference for this exercise.

### Topic: Roles and Responsibilities

Introduce roles and responsibilities for accessibility. See the [Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document) resource.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:

* Explain how accessibility responsibilities are shared among different roles within the team
* Describe some accessibility features and map them to specific roles

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Explain the different types of roles involved in implementing web accessibility. Use the [Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document) resource as a reference.
* Introduce the scope of their responsibilities throughout. Emphasize that sometimes a particular accessibility feature needs involvement from several roles.
* Go through the [Role-Based Decision Tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role-Based_Decision_Tree) resource to help students identify the specific role within the team who would be in charge of a particular accessibility feature. Ask students to decide if there would be only one role involved or if the primary owner might require help from other team members.

#### Homework Ideas

* Based on the [Role-Based Decision Tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role-Based_Decision_Tree) resource, ask students to pick up specific features of products they may be working on. Encourage them to assign their corresponding roles and responsibilities. For instance, if an alternative text is required for an image, who would provide that text? Who would implement it?

### Topic: Accessibility in an Existing Project

Introduce some strategies to address accessibility in an existing project. Use the [Web Accessibility First Aid: Approaches for Interim Repairs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/interim-repairs) resource as a reference.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:

* Explain how to identify potential accessibility issues in projects
* Describe some of the strategies to efficiently address accessibility issues

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Introduce some of the methods to gain an understanding of the current accessibility status in the project, e.g., performing a first review or carrying out a detailed accessibility evaluation. Refer to the [Web Accessibility First Aid](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/interim-repairs) resource.
* Introduce some of the strategies that can be used to prioritize issues.
* Explain how interim repairs can act as a starting point for future accessibility implementation strategies.
* Engage students to discuss accessibility issues of a given digital product. Encourage them to reflect on which of the issues they would prioritize and how these issues could be solved according to what they have already learned.

#### Homework Ideas

* Point students to a particular accessibility website or application and ask them to identify its main accessibility issues. Encourage them to share their findings. Compare the results with your own to test student's accuracy when performing first checks.
* Ask students to identify the most relevant issues in a particular digital product. Encourage them to establish the priorities and elaborate on how the issues could be solved.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

* Learners should be able to reflect on the capacity of their own organizations regarding the implementation of processes and practices related to web accessibility.
* Learners should be able to list different roles and responsibilities involved in web accessibility and describe their main responsibilities.
* Learners should be able to describe some strategies to integrate accessibility in any existing project.
