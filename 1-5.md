### Topic: Developing Policies and Statements

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce students to accessibility policies for organizations and accessibility statements for websites. See [Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies) and [Developing an Accessibility Statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/).

#### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* If possible, bring in some examples of accessibility policies you are aware of or may have access to. Explain that they serve to document organizational commitments, to encourage implementation, and to define processes. If you don't have such documents, walk students through the different elements that are needed for an effective accessibility policy. refer to [Accessibility Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies).
* Ask students to explore publicly-available accessibility statements and encourage them to reflect on some of the aspects they include.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to assess the learning outcomes:

* Report &mdash; Students draft an accessibility policy based on an organization of their choice. Assess students' capacity to define the scope of the policy, to reference current standards, and to set compliance levels.
* Presentation &mdash; Students draft an accessibility statement for a product of their choice and present it to other fellow students. Assess students' capacity to reflect on current status of the product and to elaborate on future plans to improve.

### Topic: Roles and Responsibilities

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce roles and responsibilities for accessibility. See [Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* Explain how accessibility responsibilities are shared among different roles within the team.
* Describe some accessibility features and map them to specific roles.

#### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Explain the different types of roles involved in implementing web accessibility. For reference, use [Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document).
* Introduce the scope of their responsibilities throughout. Emphasize that sometimes a particular accessibility feature needs involvement from several roles.
* Help students identify the specific role within the team who would be in charge of a particular accessibility feature. Ask students to decide if there would be only one role involved or if the primary owner might require help from other team members. Go through [Role-Based Decision Tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role-Based_Decision_Tree).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to assess the learning outcomes:

* Multiple Choice Questions &mdash; Students select specific product features and assign their corresponding roles and responsibilities. For example, if an alternative text is required for an image, who would provide that text? Who would implement it?
