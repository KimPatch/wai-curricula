{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas 

* Introduce specific considerations to integrate accessibility based on your particular learners. See the resource [Planning and Managing Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/).
* Emphasize the importance of involving real users with disabilities early, and throughout projects. See the resource [Involving Users with Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/involving-users/).
* Discuss case studies of organizations that have adopted accessibility. Analyze with students successes and challenges of such cases. See the resource [Business Case for Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/).

#### Homework Ideas

* Provide students with a multiple choice quiz in which they want to select all of the accessibility planning and managing strategies they consider important for their organization. Encourage them to elaborate on how they would integrate new accessibility strategies they might not have known about before.
* Ask students to list various roles in charge of accessibility among the team and which would be their main responsibilities.
* Ask students to pick up a product or service of their choice and to develop strategies to efficiently plan and manage accessibility. Encourage them to think about key roles and responsibilities as well as key actions that need to be taken to ensure that accessibility is maintained throughout time.
* Ask students to research for accessibility systems in their organization, and to find out which policies have been followed to achieve accessibility.

### Topic: Developing Policies and Statements

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce students to accessibility policies for organizations and accessibility statements for websites. See the resources [Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies) and [Developing an Accessibility Statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/). Emphasize that policies are mostly internal within organizations, whereas statements are public commitments on accessibility implementation.

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:

* Describe accessibility policies as a mechanism to reinforce commitment among the organization members.
* Recognize the role of accessibility statements as a way of documenting the current status of accessibility and of defining future steps and commitments.

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* If possible, bring in some examples of accessibility policies you are aware of or may have access to. Explain that they serve to document organizational commitments, to encourage implementation, and to define processes. If you don't have such documents, walk students through the different elements that are needed for an effective accessibility policy. refer to the resource [Accessibility Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies).
* Ask students to explore publicly-available accessibility statements and encourage them to reflect on some of the aspects they include.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to draft an accessibility policy based on a particular organization of their choice. Ask them to define the scope of the policy, to reference current standards, and to set compliance levels. Use the resource [Accessibility Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies).
* Ask students to draft an accessibility statement for a product of their choice. As a reference for this exercise, show the resource [Developing an Accessibility Statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/).

### Topic: Roles and Responsibilities

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce roles and responsibilities for accessibility. See the resource [Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document).

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:

* Explain how accessibility responsibilities are shared among different roles within the team.
* Describe some accessibility features and map them to specific roles.

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Explain the different types of roles involved in implementing web accessibility. For reference, use the resource [Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document).
* Introduce the scope of their responsibilities throughout. Emphasize that sometimes a particular accessibility feature needs involvement from several roles.
* Help students identify the specific role within the team who would be in charge of a particular accessibility feature. Ask students to decide if there would be only one role involved or if the primary owner might require help from other team members. Go through the resource [Role-Based Decision Tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role-Based_Decision_Tree).

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to pick up specific features of products they may be working on. Encourage them to assign their corresponding roles and responsibilities. For instance, if an alternative text is required for an image, who would provide that text? Who would implement it? Base this exercise on the resource [Role-Based Decision Tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role-Based_Decision_Tree).

* Point students to a particular accessibility website or application and ask them to identify its main accessibility issues. Encourage them to share their findings. Compare the results with your own to test student's accuracy when performing first checks.
* Ask students to identify the most relevant issues in a particular digital product. Encourage them to establish the priorities and elaborate on how the issues could be solved.
