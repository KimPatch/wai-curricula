The objective for this unit is to introduce resources on how to plan, manage and apply accessibility within organizations. It provides an overview on different accessibility roles and responsibilities involved throughout the design and development process, and on organizational planning and managing considerations to ensure accessibility as part of the process. It is recommended:

* To emphasize how to involve people with disabilities in the whole design and development process
* To help develop policies on how to implement accessibility and respond to accessibility/related queries.

### Topic: Planning and managing web accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

* Introduce specific considerations to integrate accessibility throughout the design process. This includes:
	* Ensuring management commitment to accessibility
	* Assigning appropriate roles and responsibilities
	* Providing technical and financial resources
	* and ensuring quality management.
* Explain how the capability and maturity of an organization with regard to web accessibility can be assessed based on these considerations.
* Provide resources about involving real users with disabilities early on in the design process, and throughout the development and maintenance stages of websites.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding that sharing responsibilities amongst the team members according to their role is necessary for accessibility to be part of the organization culture.
* Understanding that resources need to be put in place at a technical and at a financial level so that accessibility can be integrated.
* Understanding the importance of  managerial staff's commitment to accessibility.
* Awareness on the role that Quality Management plays within the organization, since various accessibility requirements are strongly dependent on that matter.
* Understanding the need of incorporating people with disabilities into web development and testing

### Topic: Developing policies on web accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

* Provide information about putting accessibility policies in place:
	* to document organizational commitments
	* to encourage implementation of web accessibility.
* If possible, reference publicly available accessibility statements and emphasize:
	* that they help increase the commitment to accessibility
	* that they serve to communicate the efforts undertaken by organizations towards accessibility.
* Ask learners to reflect on general use of policies at their organization.
* Introduce some of the strategies that can be used to prioritize issues and pursue interim repairs, which can become necessary when accessibility is not considered from the start of the design and development process.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding the strategic importance of accessibility policies to ensure and reinforce commitment among the organization members.
* Knowledge of some of the strategies to prioritize issues and pursue interim repairs.
* Awareness on some current accessibility commitments from organizations.

#### Approximate duration.

30 minutes.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

**Presentational**: introduce students to current accessibility policies so that they become familiar with their main elements. Elaborate on the fact that there needs to be a commitment on tangible goals and achievements as well as on current standards and policies, ideally referencing directly those from the W3C and contemplating mechanisms to accommodate smoothly to updates on the standards as they appear.

#### Suggested teaching materials

* [Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies/)
* [Developing an Accessibility Statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/)

## Suggested teaching methods

**Presentational** &mdash; Introduce the different types of roles and responsibilities, and considerations for integrating accessibility throughout the design and development process. Encourage learners to reflect on these.

## Suggested Teaching Materials

* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document">(Work in progress) Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities Mapping (ARRM): Role Definition</a> &mdash; Defines a variety of roles relevant for accessibility throughout the design and development process. It includes examples tasks in accessibility for each of the roles defined.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/">Planning and Managing Web Accessibility</a> &mdash; Enumerates and explains a broad selection of organizational considerations relating to web accessibility. These are organized according to web project management stages of "Initiate", "Plan", "Implement", and "Sustain", to help fit into organizational processes.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/involving-users/">Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility</a> &mdash; Explains the benefits of involving real users with disabilities from the inception of web projects throughout their design and development stages, and provides advice on working with people with disabilities effectively.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies/">Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility</a> &mdash; Provides step-by-step guidance on developing organizational policies relating to web accessibility.

## Ideas for Assessment

* **Knowledge Questions** &mdash; Learners should be able to enumerate different roles and responsibilities involved in web accessibility, and different organizational considerations to plan for and manage implementation.
* **Reflections** &mdash; Learners should be able to reflect on the capacity and maturity of their own organizations regarding web accessibility with respect to (lack of) accessibility processes and practices put in place.

## Notes

* **Business context** &mdash; The business context that learners are used to may also require adjustment of the suggested considerations. For example, policies often apply differently to public and private bodies.
