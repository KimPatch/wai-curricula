## Introduction
{:.no-display}

The aims of this unit are to:
* Provide students with an overview on the W3C accessibility standards and guidelines, as well as the principles of accessible design
* Introduce students to performing preliminary accessibility checks. 

Tip: Relate these standards to the inter-relation between components for accessibility which were introduced in the first units of this module. 

## Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* Define the scope of Web Content, Authoring Tools, User Agent, and Accessible Rich Internet Application Guidelines and their relevance for accessibility
* Explain how W3C standards are developed and recognize their adoption by businesses internationally
* Describe different design and development requirements, and examples for each
* Define the terms “Perceivable”, “Operable”, “Understandable”, and “Robust” (POUR)
* Carry out first accessibility checks of simple web pages

## Competences 

The following is a list of skills required for this unit.

Learners

### Topic: Standards and Guidelines

Use the [W3C Accessibility Standards Overview](/standards-guidelines/) resource to introduce the scope of the W3C/WAI accessibility standards. It includes desktop and mobile websites and applications, authoring tools, web browsers, and some types of assistive tools.

Use the [How WAI Develops Accessibility Standards through the W3C Process](/standards-guidelines/w3c-process) to go through the development stages of the standards.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* List the current WAI standards: WCAG, ATAG, UAAG, and ARIA
* Explain the structure and goals of these standards: their principles, guidelines, requirements, and the type of audience and components they address
* Explain the inter-relations between these standards, web technologies, and accessibility components
* Describe the public approach of the standards' development process, with involvement from organizations of people with disabilities, industry, public bodies, and individuals interested

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Explain the overall structure and sections of these standards. Relate them with web technologies and components such as HTML, authoring tools, web browsers, assistive tools, and media players.
* Highlight that W3c/WAI updates the standards periodically. Underline that updates respond to changes in technologies, components, and user needs.
* Refer to the uptake of W3C/WAI guidelines in different policies and standards internationally.
* Explain that these W3C accessibility standards and guidelines are developed following an open consensus process, with involvement of representation of people with disabilities, industry, public, and research bodies, and individual experts.
* Discuss with students the specific role of each of the standards mentioned and encourage them to reflect on which of them relates to their environment.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to write a short paragraph for each of the standards. Encourage them to define its scope and overall structure and to mention the web technologies and components they address.
* Pick up several accessibility issues. Ask students to decide which standard covers these issues and to which specific section of the standard they belong.
* Ask students to comment on accessibility standards or guidelines in their zone, if any. Ask them to specify if they have been inherited from W3C/WAI. If not, ask them to give a brief overview of which things they have in common with the W3C Accessibility standards.

### Topic: Principles of Accessible Design

Refer to the [Accessibility Principles](/accessibility-principles/) resource to explain the terms “Perceivable”, “Operable”, “Understandable”, and “Robust”¢ (POUR).

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* Explain the terms “Perceivable”, “Operable”, “Understandable”, and “Robust”
* Identify some guidelines for each of the principles
* List some examples of accessibility requirements pertaining to each of the guidelines

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Provide students with the definition of the four accessibility principles: “Perceivable”, “Operable”, “Understandable”, and “Robust”.
* Introduce the guidelines for each of these principles, and provide specific examples to help explain the meaning and relevance of each. For instance, refer to a specific requirement regarding the guideline 1.4 Distinguishable. Emphasize how such requirements are essential for people with disabilities but also benefit all web users.
* Reflect with students on which of these principles relates more to their daily tasks or activities and how they could apply such principles in their daily job.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to write a short essay commenting on the four principles of web accessibility and their corresponding guidelines.

### Topic: First Checks for Web Accessibility

Use the [Easy Checks](/test-evaluate/preliminary/) resource as a reference to guide learners through preliminary checks for web accessibility on simple web pages. Show them how to identify page headings and their relative order, use by keyboard, contrast, and other indicative checks. 

**NOTE:** This topic is not intended for students to carry out full conformance evaluation, which requires technical skills and further accessibility knowledge. 

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:

* Identify potential accessibility issues such as those related to keyboard navigation or to heading order
* Relate the findings to the principles of WCAG they belong to

#### Duration.

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Introduce learners to basic accessibility checks. Remember the importance of using several input and output methods such as mice or keyboards. Encourage students to use assistive tools such as screen readers, to check for possible accessibility issues.
* Ask learners to explore different types of websites and relate their findings to the accessibility principles and guidelines.
* Ask students to perform some accessibility checks in a web page of choice. Encourage them to use the keyboard and to use some assistive tool such as a screen reader to navigate and interact with the website.

#### Homework Ideas

* Note down the results of their checks: what the specific problem is, which principle it belongs to, and how this issue might be resolved.
* Ask students to pick up three accessibility first checks and try to look for them in several websites to see how common they are. Ask them to relate the checks with a specific group of users and to point to solutions for the problems they found in the analyzed websites.

## Ideas for Assessment

* Learners should be able to identify the scope of each of the WAI standards and list some of its guidelines and requirements.
* Learners should be able to explain the principles of web accessibility and enumerate different guidelines. Learners should be able to provide examples of web content, authoring tools, and user agents.
* Learners should be able to carry out first checks of accessibility principles on simple web pages. Learners can compare the accessibility of different websites or different pages on the same website.
