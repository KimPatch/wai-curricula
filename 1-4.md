* Explain the web accessibility concepts: perceivable information and user interface, operable user interface and navigation, understandable information and user interface, and robust content and reliable interpretation.
* Provide examples of each of the principles.
* Reflect with students on which of these principles relate more to their daily tasks or activities and how they could apply such principles in their daily life.

#### Ideas for Assessment

The following is a list of homework activities that help students achieve the learning outcomes. Select the ones that best apply to your audience and context or add your own.

* Students write a summary describing the four principles of web accessibility and give examples, such as Captions and Other Alternatives for Multimedia under the principle Perceivable.
* Students describe other examples of each principle (beyond what is in the W3C "Accessibility Principles" resource).

### Topic: W3C Accessibility Standards

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the scope of the W3C accessibility standards. It includes desktop and mobile websites and applications, authoring tools (like Content Management Systems, CMS), and user agents (like web browsers). Use the resource [W3C Accessibility Standards Overview](https://www.w3.org/wai/standards-guidelines/).

Go through the milestones in WAI's standards development. Use the resource [How WAI Develops Accessibility Standards through the W3C Process](https://www.w3.org/wai/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* List the W3C accessibility standards: WCAG, ATAG, UAAG, and WAI-ARIA.
* Describe their structure, principles, guidelines, success criteria, and the type of audience and components they address.
* Explain how these standards, web technologies, and accessibility components relate.
* Explain the role that harmonization of standards plays in increasing the accessibility of the Web for people with disabilities.
* Describe how the public approach of standards development involves people with disabilities, industry, public bodies, and other individuals.

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Explain the overall structure and sections of the standards. Relate them to web technologies and components such as HTML, authoring tools, web browsers, assistive tools, and media players. Use the resource [Essential Components of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/).
* Highlight that W3C updates standards periodically. Underline that updates respond to changes in technologies, components, and user needs.
* Refer to the inclusion of W3C accessibility standards in different policies and standards internationally.
* Explain that WAI develops these standards following the W3C process, with involvement of people with disabilities, industry, public, and research bodies, and individual experts.
* Discuss with students the specific role of each of the standards mentioned and compare them with other applicable technical guidelines (if any). Use the resource [Why Standards Harmonization is Essential to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/harmonization/)

#### Ideas for Assessment

The following is a list of homework activities that help students achieve the learning outcomes. Select the ones that best apply to your audience and context or add your own.

* Students write a short paragraph about each standard, focusing on their scope and overall structure. Students elaborate on the web technologies and components they address.
* Students describe several accessibility issues. Students decide which standard and specific section covers each issue.
* Students comment on accessibility laws and policies in their region, if any. Students specify if they have been adopted from W3C standards. If not, students give a brief overview of similarities and differences to the W3C accessibility standards.
* Students research if there are other technical guidelines for accessibility in a given organization. Students specify if they diverge from W3C accessibility standards.

### Topic: Hands-on Experience of Standards

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Give students hands-on experience checking how web pages have implemented accessibility principles and WCAG standards, or not. For reference, use the resource [Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/wai/test-evaluate/preliminary/).

**NOTE:** In this topic students can try their knowledge of accessibility principles and standards. Accessibility evaluation is beyond the scope of this module. It requires more skills and accessibility knowledge than has been taught so far. 

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* Identify potential accessibility barriers such as those listed in the Easy Checks resource.
* Relate their findings to the relevant WCAG success criteria.

{% comment %}

#### Duration.

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Introduce students to basic accessibility checks. Anyone using the web can perform these checks. Note that the tools listed in Easy Checks are advisable but not required to perform the checks.
* Ask students to check different types of web pages and relate their findings to the accessibility principles and standards.

#### Ideas for Assessment

The following is a list of homework activities that help students achieve the learning outcomes. Select the ones that best apply to your audience and context or add your own.

* Students select several accessibility checks and explain which principle(s) and success criteria they belong to. For example, students select the check Page Titles and attach it to the principle Operable.
* Students choose three accessibility checks from the resource [Easy Checks](https://www.w3.org/wai/test-evaluate/preliminary/). Students try the checks on several web pages and report results. Students relate the checks to specific groups of users and point to solutions for the problems they found in the analyzed websites.

## Ideas for Assessment

Optional ideas to assess the learning outcomes.

* Presentation &mdash; Students explain the four “POUR principles” of web accessibility and refer to specifics. For example, students elaborate on Identifying The First Language of a Page under the principle Understandable.
* Short Answer questions &mdash; From specific examples of accessibility features, students identify which principle they belong to and which users it helps. For example, Functionality Available from the Keyboard belongs to the principle Operable and helps keyboard users as well as people using voice recognition software.
* Concept Map &mdash; Students relate the principles of accessible design to web content, authoring tools, and user agents.
* Report &mdash; Students summarize the scope of the W3C accessibility standards and explain some of their guidelines and success criteria.
* Practical Experiments &mdash; Students carry out basic accessibility evaluation.
