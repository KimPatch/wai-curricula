## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this unit:
* introduce the accessibility principles Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust

## Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* Explain the web accessibility concepts Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR), and give examples of each.

* Describe the supporting technical materials for these standards, how they are related and linked, and what is normative versus non-normative/informative. 
* Explain how W3C accessibility standards are developed.
* List examples of WCAG adoption in policies internationally.
* Evaluate web pages to identify potential accessibility barriers and explain how they fit under a POUR principle and success criteria.

The following topics help achieve the learning outcomes. Adapt the sequence of topics, the activities you do, and the homework you assign for your particular students and context.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Principles of Accessible Design

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the web accessibility concepts Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR). Use the resource [Accessibility Principles](https://www.w3.org/wai/accessibility-principles/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:
* Explain the concepts of “Perceivable”, “Operable”, “Understandable”, and “Robust” as principles of web accessibility
* List examples of each of the principles

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Explain the web accessibility concepts: perceivable information and user interface, operable user interface and navigation, understandable information and user interface, and robust content and reliable interpretation.
* Provide examples of each of the principles.
* Reflect with students on which of these principles relate more to their daily tasks or activities and how they could apply such principles in their daily job.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to write a short essay commenting on the four principles of web accessibility.
* Ask students to come up with other examples of each principle (beyond what is in the W3C "Accessibility Principles" resource).
* Ask students to choose a principle and explain why it is essential for people with disabilities, and how it benefits all users in specific situations.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Standards and Guidelines

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce W3C accessibility standards. Use the resource [W3C Accessibility Standards Overview](https://www.w3.org/wai/standards-guidelines/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* Define the scope of the 4 main W3C accessibility standards: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG), User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG), and Accessible Rich Internet Application (WAI-ARIA).
* Describe the supporting technical materials for these standards, how they are related and linked, and what is normative versus non-normative/informative. 
* Explain how W3C accessibility standards are developed.
* List examples of WCAG adoption in policies internationally.

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Explain the scope of WCAG, ATAG, UAAG, and WAI-ARIA and how they are related. Use the resource [Essential Components of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/).
* For each standard, explain the basic structure, the supporting technical documents (such as Understanding WCAG), and how they are related and linked. Use the resources [WCAG Overview]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), [ATAG Overview]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/), [UAAG Overview]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/), and [WAI-ARIA Overview]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/).
* Explain the difference between normative and non-normative/informative sections in standards and documents. Use the resource [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques).
* Explain that a specific W3C standard will not change, that an updated version may be published later, and that supporting technical resources are updated more frequently. In the resource "WCAG 2 FAQ", use [Is WCAG 2 stable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/#done).
* Explain that WAI develops these standards following the W3C consensus-based process. It involves different stakeholders in web accessibility, including industry, disability organizations, government, accessibility research organizations, and more.
* Mention that W3C accessibility standards are referenced in policies and other standards internationally. Use the resource [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/) and FAQ: [Is ISO/IEC 40500 the same as WCAG 2.0?](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/#iso).
* Discuss with students the specific role of each of the standards and encourage them to reflect on how each standard relates to their environment.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to write a short paragraph for each of the standards. Encourage them to define its scope and overall structure and to mention the web technologies and components they address.
* Give students a list of accessibility issues. Ask students to decide which standard covers each issue and which specific section of the standard are addressed in.
* Ask students to comment on accessibility laws and policies in their region, if any. Ask them to specify if the local policies include or reference W3C standards. If not, encourage them to give a brief overview of the similarities and differences between the local policies and W3C accessibility standards.

### Topic: First Checks for Web Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Give students hands-on experience checking how web pages have implemented accessibility principles and WCAG standards, or not. For reference, use the resource [Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/wai/test-evaluate/preliminary/).

**NOTE:** This topic is intended for students to put their knowledge of the accessibility principles and standards into practice. Full conformance evaluation is beyond the scope of this module. It requires more skills and accessibility knowledge than has been taught so far. 

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* Identify potential accessibility barriers such as those listed in the Easy Checks resource
 * Relate their findings to the relevant WCAG success criteria

{% comment %}

#### Duration.

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Introduce students to basic accessibility checks. Remember that anyone with knowledge on how to use the web can perform these checks. Emphasize that the tools listed are advisable but not required to perform the checks.
* Ask students to check different types of web pages and relate their findings to the accessibility principles and standards.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to choose three accessibility checks from the resource [Easy Checks](https://www.w3.org/wai/test-evaluate/preliminary/). Have students try the checks on several web pages and report results. Ask them to relate the checks with a specific group of users and to point to solutions for the problems they found in the analyzed websites.
* Ask students to select one accessibility check for each of the principles they learned in previous topics and explain why the check falls under the principle.

## Ideas for Assessment

Students should be able to:

* Explain the 4 principles of web accessibility.
* Relate the principles of accessible design to web content, authoring tools, and user agents.
* Identify the scope of each of the 4 main W3C accessibility standards and explain some of their guidelines and success criteria
* Carry out basic accessibility checks
