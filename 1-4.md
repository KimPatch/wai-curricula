## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This unit:
* introduces students to the accessibility principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

* relates the standards' requirements to preliminary accessibility checks. 

## Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* Define the terms “Perceivable”, “Operable”, “Understandable”, and “Robust” (POUR)
* Define the scope of Web Content, Authoring Tools, User Agent, and Accessible Rich Internet Application Guidelines and their relevance for accessibility
* Explain how W3C accessibility standards are developed and recognize their adoption by policy makers internationally
* Describe different design and development requirements and examples for each
* Carry out first accessibility checks of simple web pages

## Competencies 

The following is a list of skills required for this unit.

Students
: Basic &mdash; Basic understanding of computers and the Web.

Instructors

## Topics to Teach

The following topics help achieve the learning outcomes. Adapt the sequence of topics, the activities you do, and the homework you assign for your particular students and context.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Principles of Accessible Design

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the terms “Perceivable”, “Operable”, “Understandable”, and “Robust” (POUR). Use the resource [Accessibility Principles](/accessibility-principles/) 

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:
* Identify the terms “Perceivable”, “Operable”, “Understandable”, and “Robust” as the principles of accessibility
* Explain some requirements from each of the principles
* List some examples of accessibility requirements for each of the principles

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Introduce students to the terms “Perceivable”, “Operable”, “Understandable”, and “Robust”. Explain that each of the standards has a set of requirements pertaining to each of these principles.
* Introduce the requirements for each of these principles. For instance, refer to requirements regarding Distinguishability. Emphasize how such requirements are essential for people with disabilities but also benefit all web users.
* Reflect with students on which of these principles relate more to their daily tasks or activities and how they could apply such principles in their daily job.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to write a short essay commenting on the four principles of web accessibility and their corresponding guidelines.
* Pick up at least three accessibility requirements and ask students to determine which principle they belong to. Encourage them to list at least two guidelines related to the requirement you have chosen. For instance, use the 

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Standards and Guidelines

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the scope of the WAI accessibility standards. It includes desktop and mobile websites and applications, authoring tools, and user agents. Use the resource [W3C Accessibility Standards Overview](/standards-guidelines/) 

Go through the milestones in WAI standard's development. Use the resource [How WAI Develops Accessibility Standards through the W3C Process](/standards-guidelines/w3c-process) 

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* List the current W3C accessibility standards: Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
(ATAG), User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) and Accessible Rich
Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)
* Describe their structure, principles, guidelines, requirements, and the type of audience and components they address
* Explain the interrelations between these standards, web technologies, and accessibility components
* Describe the public approach of the standards' development process, with involvement from organizations of people with disabilities, industry, public bodies, and individuals interested

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Explain the overall structure and sections of these standards. Relate them with web technologies and components such as HTML, authoring tools, web browsers, assistive tools, and media players.
* Highlight that W3c/WAI updates the standards periodically. Underline that updates respond to changes in technologies, components, and user needs.
* Refer to the inclusion of W3C/WAI guidelines in different policies and standards internationally.
* Explain that WAI develops these standards following the W3C process, with involvement of representation of people with disabilities, industry, public, and research bodies, and individual experts.
* Discuss with students the specific role of each of the standards mentioned and encourage them to reflect on which of them relates to their environment.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to write a short paragraph for each of the standards. Encourage them to define its scope and overall structure and to mention the web technologies and components they address.
* Pick up several accessibility issues. Ask students to decide which standard covers these issues and which specific section of the standard they belong to.
* Ask students to comment on accessibility guidelines in their region, if any. Ask them to specify if they have been inherited from WAI. If not, encourage them to give a brief overview of which similarities and differences they have with respect to the W3C accessibility standards.

### Topic: First Checks for Web Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Relate the principles and standards to some preliminary checks for web accessibility on simple web pages. For instance, show students how to identify page headings and their relative order, use with keyboard, contrast, and other checks. For reference, use the resource [Easy Checks](/test-evaluate/preliminary/).

**NOTE:** This topic is intended for students to practice their knowledge on the accessibility components, principles and standards. Carrying out full conformance evaluation is beyond the scope of this module. It requires technical skills and further accessibility knowledge. 

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* Identify potential accessibility issues such as those related to keyboard navigation or to heading order
* Relate their findings to the standards and principles they belong to

#### Duration.

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Introduce students to basic accessibility checks. Remember that anyone with knowledge on how to use the web can perform these checks. Emphasize that the tools listed are advisable but not required to perform the checks.
* Ask students to explore different types of websites and relate their findings to the accessibility principles. For instance, use the check “Headings” to speak about the “understandable” principle and use “Keyboard access and visual focus” to refer to the “Operable” principle.
* Ask students to perform some accessibility checks in a web page of choice. Encourage them to use the keyboard and to use some assistive tools such as a screen reader to navigate and interact with the website.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to pick up three accessibility first checks and try to look for them in several websites to see how common they are. Ask them to relate the checks with a specific group of users and to point to solutions for the problems they found in the analyzed websites.
* Ask students to select one accessibility check for each of the principles they learned in previous topics and explain why the check falls under the principle.

## Ideas for Assessment

Students should be able to:

* Explain the principles of web accessibility and enumerate different guidelines.
* Relate the principles of accessible design to web content, authoring tools, and user agents.
* Identify the scope of each of the W3C accessibility standards and list some of its guidelines and requirements
* Carry out first checks of accessibility principles on simple web pages, and compare the results among them.
