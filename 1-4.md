## Suggested teaching outline

the objective of this unit is to provide students with an overview on the W3C accessibility standards and guidelines, to introduce the way they are developed within the W3C, to present accessibility principles, design and development requirements, and to introduce students to performing preliminary accessibility checks. It consists of the following lessons:
* Web Accessibility Standards: provides an overview on the Web Accessibility Standards from the W3C and explains their overall goals and structure.
* Web Accessibility Principles: explains the terms Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR) and introduces the Guidelines defined by WCAG for each of these principles.
* First checks for web accessibility: guides learners through preliminary checks for web accessibility on simple web pages.

**Tip**: Revise the inter-relation between accessibility features in web technologies such as HTML, in web content, web authoring tools, web browsers, and assistive tools, which were introduced in the first teaching unit of this module. Relate this back to more specific examples for the second teaching module and highlight the broader benefits of these examples. Reiterate that accessibility encompasses many types of roles and responsibilities.

**Note**: This is a suggested teaching outline to help achieve the learning outcomes. Instructors might choose to adapt the sequence of the lessons or their content according to the particular audience and context.

### Lesson 1: Web Accessibility Standards

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the scope of the W3C/WAI accessibility standards, which includes desktop and mobile websites and applications, authoring tools, web browsers, and some types of assistive tools. Highlight that there are several versions of each of the standards, trying to better respond to changes in technologies and components and also to changes in user needs and preferences. Refer to the uptake of W3C/WAI standards in different policies and standards. Explain that these W3C accessibility standards and guidelines are developed following an open consensus process, with involvement of representation of people with disabilities, industry, public bodies, research, and individual experts. W3C Working Groups publish working drafts periodically for comments from the public. Everyone is encouraged to comment, to help include many perspectives thus ensure broad consensus around these standards.

#### Learning outcomes

* Knowledge of the current W3C web accessibility standards: WCAG, ATAG, UAAG, and ARIA.
* Understanding the structure and goals of these standards: their principles, guidelines, requirements and the type of audience and components they address.
* Understanding that updates on these standards might lead to new versions responding to changes on technologies and user needs.
* Awareness on the inter-relation between these standards with the web technologies and accessibility components such as HTML, authoring tools, user agents and web applications.
* Knowledge of the public approach of the standards development process, with involvement from organizations of people with disabilities, industry, public bodies and individuals interested.

#### Approximate duration.

30 minutes.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

**Presentational**: provide students with an outline of WCAG, ATAG, UAAG, and ARIA. Explain their overall structure and sections and relate them with web technologies and components such as HTML, authoring tools,web browsers, assistive tools, and media players.

#### Suggested activities 

Discuss with students the particular role of each of the standards mentioned and encourage them to reflect on which of them is more related to their particular environment.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to write a short paragraph for each of the standards defining its scope and overall structure and mentioning the web technologies and components they address.

### Lesson 2: Web accessibility principles

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain the terms Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR) based on how they are defined in WCAG. Introduce the Guidelines defined by WCAG for each of these principles, and provide specific examples to help explain the meaning and relevance of each. For instance, refer to a specific requirement regarding the Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable. Emphasize how such requirements are essential for people with disabilities but also benefit all web users.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding the terms "Perceivable", "Operable", "Understandable" and "Robust" in the context of WCAG.
* Knowledge of the overall structure for each of the principles and guidelines.
* Knowledge of some examples of accessibility requirements pertaining to each of the guidelines.

#### Approximate duration.

30 minutes.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

**Presentational**: Provide students with the definition of the four WCAG principles: "Perceivable", "Operable", "Understandable", and "Robust". Provide examples of some of the requirements, common problems they try to address, and some of the possible solutions.

#### Suggested activities 

Engage students in a discussion about the four accessibility principles. Reflect with them on which of these principles is more related to their daily tasks or activities and how they could apply such principles in their daily job.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to write a short essay commenting on the four principles of web accessibility and their corresponding guidelines.

### Lesson 3: First checks for web accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Guide learners through preliminary checks for web accessibility on simple web pages; for example, to identify page headings and their relative order, use by keyboard and other indicative checks (not full conformance evaluation, which requires technical skills and further accessibility knowledge). Ask learners to explore different types of websites and relate their findings to the accessibility principles and guidelines.

**Note**: Explain them that paying attention to some basic HTML elements can give us a clue on how the accessibility of a web page might look like. Talk to students about heading order and structure or keyboard navigation.

#### Learning outcomes

* Knowledge about identifying potential accessibility issues such as keyboard navigation or heading order.
* Relating the findings to the principles of WCAG 

#### Approximate duration.

30 minutes.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

**Practical**: introduce learners to basic accessibility checks. Remember the importance of using several input and output methods such as mice, keyboards, and of using assistive tools such as screen readers, to check for possible accessibility issues.

#### Suggested activities 

Ask students to perform some accessibility checks in a web page of choice. Encourage them to use the keyboard and to use some assistive tool such as a screen reader to navigate and interact with the website.

#### Suggested homework

Ask students to note down the results of their checks: what the specific problem is, to which principle it belongs, and how this issue might be resolved.

## Ideas for Assessment

* **Knowledge Questions** &mdash; Learners should be able to explain the principles of web accessibility and enumerate different guidelines. Learners should be able to provide examples of web content, authoring tools, and user agents.
* **Presentations** &mdash; Learners should be able to carry out first checks of accessibility principles on simple web pages. Learners can compare the accessibility of different websites or different pages on the same website.

## Notes

  * **Technical jargon** &mdash; This teaching unit explores technical standards and resources, which include technical jargon. It will be important to explain terms and phrases in a more understandable way to most learners.
