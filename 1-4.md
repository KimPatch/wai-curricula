## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this unit:
* introduce the accessibility principles Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust
* introduce W3C accessibility guidelines and other standards, and their supporting resources
* provide on hands-on experience checking how web pages have implemented the standards or not

## Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* Explain the web accessibility concepts Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR), and give examples of each.
* define the scope of Web Content, Authoring Tools, and User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG, UAAG, and ATAG) as well as the Accessible Rich Internet Application (WAI-ARIA) 
* Explain how W3C accessibility standards are developed.
* List examples of WCAG adoption in policies internationally.
* Check web pages to identify potential accessibility barriers and explain how they fit under a POUR principle and success criteria.

## Competencies 

The following is a list of skills required for this unit.

Students

## Topics to Teach

The following topics help achieve the learning outcomes. Adapt the sequence of topics, the activities you do, and the homework you assign for your particular students and context.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Principles of Web Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the web accessibility concepts Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR). Use the resource [Accessibility Principles](https://www.w3.org/wai/accessibility-principles/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:
* Explain the concepts of “Perceivable”, “Operable”, “Understandable”, and “Robust” as principles of web accessibility
* List examples of each of the principles

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Explain the web accessibility concepts: perceivable information and user interface, operable user interface and navigation, understandable information and user interface, and robust content and reliable interpretation.
* Provide examples of each of the principles.
* Reflect with students on which of these principles relate more to their daily tasks or activities and how they could apply such principles in their daily job.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to write a short essay commenting on the four principles of web accessibility and their corresponding guidelines.
* Ask students to come up with other examples of each principle (beyond what is in the W3C "Accessibility Principles" resource).
* Ask students to choose a principle and explain why it is essential for people with disabilities, and how it benefits all users in specific situations.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Guidelines and other Standards

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce the scope of the W3C accessibility standards. It includes desktop and mobile websites and applications, authoring tools (like Content Management Systems, CMS), and user agents (like web browsers). Use the resource [W3C Accessibility Standards Overview](https://www.w3.org/wai/standards-guidelines/).

Go through the milestones in WAI’s standards development. Use the resource [How WAI Develops Accessibility Standards through the W3C Process](https://www.w3.org/wai/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* list the current main W3C accessibility standards: WCAG, ATAG, UAAG, and WAI-ARIA
* describe their structure, principles, guidelines, requirements, and the type of audience and components they address
* explain how these standards, web technologies, and accessibility components relate
* describe how the public approach of standards development involves people with disabilities, industry, public bodies, and other individuals. 

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Explain the overall structure and sections of the standards. Relate them with web technologies and components such as HTML, authoring tools, web browsers, assistive tools, and media players. Use the resource [Essential Components of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/).
* Highlight that W3C updates standards periodically. Underline that updates respond to changes in technologies, components, and user needs.
* Refer to the inclusion of W3C accessibility standards in different policies and standards internationally.
* Explain that WAI develops these standards following the W3C process, with involvement of representation of people with disabilities, industry, public, and research bodies, and individual experts.
* Discuss with students the specific role of each of the standards mentioned and encourage them to reflect on how the standards relate to their environment.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to write a short paragraph about each standard. Encourage them to point out their scope and overall structure and to mention the web technologies and components they address.
* Describe several accessibility issues. Ask students to decide which standard and specific section covers each issue.
* Ask students to comment on accessibility laws and policies in their region, if any. Ask them to specify if they have been adopted from W3C standards. If not, encourage them to give a brief overview of similarities and differences to the W3C accessibility standards.

### Topic: First Checks for Web Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Give students hands-on experience checking how web pages have implemented accessibility principles and WCAG standards, or not. For reference, use the resource [Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/wai/test-evaluate/preliminary/).

**NOTE:** In this topic students can put their knowledge of accessibility principles and standards into practice. Full conformance evaluation is beyond the scope of this module. It requires more skills and accessibility knowledge than has been taught so far. 

#### Learning Outcomes

Students should be able to:

* identify potential accessibility barriers such as those listed in the Easy Checks resource
* relate their findings to the relevant WCAG success criteria

{% comment %}

#### Duration.

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Introduce students to basic accessibility checks. Anyone using the web can perform these checks. Note that the tools listed in Easy Checks are advisable but not required to perform the checks.
* Ask students to check different types of web pages and relate their findings to the accessibility principles and standards.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to choose three accessibility checks from the resource [Easy Checks](https://www.w3.org/wai/test-evaluate/preliminary/). Have students try the checks on several web pages and report results. Ask them to relate the checks to specific groups of users and point to solutions for the problems they found in the analyzed websites.
* Ask students to select one accessibility check for each of the principles they learned in previous topics and explain why the check falls under the principle. 

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

## Ideas for Assessment

Students should be able to:

* Explain the four “POUR principles” of web accessibility.
* Relate the principles of accessible design to web content, authoring tools, and user agents.
* Identify the scope of each of the four main W3C accessibility standards and explain some of their guidelines and success criteria.
* Carry out basic accessibility checks.
