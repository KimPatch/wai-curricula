## Stories of people with disabilities
In this unit, the main objective is to focus on the specific way in which the particular person that will be benefited from accessibility uses technology. Instructors are intended to engage learners by providing them as much input as they can on the particular aspects of how people with disabilities interact with the Web. Learners abilities will be increased in the following manner:
  * Raising awareness of diverse types of disabilities and related accessibility needs
  * Gainning an understanding of how this particular personas are using the web. 
  * Interpreting the needs of such personas when it comes to their usage of web technologies.
  * Responding in a fast an efficient manner to the possible demands of people with disabilities that fall under their field of action.
  * Understanding the most common barriers and issues that people with disabilities face when navigating the web.

Aproximate duration: 3 hour.
### Teaching outline
  * Stories of people with disabilities - Bring actual people with disabilities and let them explain themselves showing the audience the technologies they use in a daily basis. If bringing people is not possible, try to use videos as much as you can, since they will help to raise engagement and awareness among learners. Focus specifically in the following areas of interest, since they will serve you to introduce and prepare the audience for the next subunits in this module:
    * Different ways of perception (people who are not able to perceive colour, images, media content.
    * Different ways of interacting with technology (input and output methods): people who do not use the mouse, the keyboard
  * Diverse abilities - Try to reflect the fact that people with disabilities are not homogeneous and that there is a wide range of different scenarios to address. Some of the most important ones are the following:
    * Auditory
    * Cognitive
    * Physical
    * Speech
    * Visual
 
### Suggested teaching methods 
If it is possible in your particular set up, bring people with disabilities and encourage them to explain their daily experience while navigating the web. Use examples that are related to the learner's interests and select web environments that are well-known to learners. This way, they can better understand the issues people with disabilities might have while they still are in a familiar environment. If it is not possible to bring people with disabilities, use videos and other types of multimedia content to raise engagement among the audience.
### Suggested teaching materials:
  * <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/">Stories of web users</a>
  * <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos//">Web Accessibility perspectives</a>
    
### Ideas for assessment.
  * Learners should be able to acknowledge that there is people using technology in a different way than the one they might be used to. 
  * They should need to learn to adjust to the constant changes produced by the diversity of people with disabilities. 
  * They should also be aware that people might use the so-called assistive technologies when mainstream solutions do not offer enough support for them.
### Notes
Make learners share their thoughts and opinions together with the people with disabilities you have brought or, if you can't bring people, promote a discussion among learners and yourself in whichyou emphasise how relevant it is for accessibility that the audience is aware of the different aspects that need to be taken into account when understanding the needs of the particular users with disabilities. These discussions will serve for further and deeper knowledge that will be taught in future units and lessons.
