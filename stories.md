  <dt>Teaching outline</dt>
  <dd><ul>
   <li>Stories of people with disabilities - Bring actual people with disabilities and let them explain themselves showing the audience the technologies they use in a daily basis. If bringing people is not possible, try to use videos as much as you can, since they will help to raise engagement and awareness among learners. Focus specifically in the following areas of interest:
      <ul><li>Different ways of perception (people who are not able to perceive colour, images, media content.</li>
      <li>Different ways of interacting with technology (input and output methods): people who do not use the mouse, the keyboard</li></ul>
   <li>Diverse abilities - Try to reflect the fact that people with disabilities are not homogeneous and that there is a wide range of different scenarios to address. Some of the most important ones are the following:</li>
   <ul><li>Auditory</li>
     <li>Cognitive</li>
     <li>Physical</li>
     <li>Speech</li>
     <li>Visual</li></ul>
 </ul></dd>
 <dt>Suggested teaching methods</dt>
 <dd>If it is possible in your particular set up, bring people with disabilities and encourage them to explain their daily experience while navigating the web. Use examples that are related to the learner's interests and select web environments that are well-known to learners. This way, they can better understand the issues people with disabilities might have while they still are in a familiar environment. If it is not possible to bring people with disabilities, use videos and other types of multimedia content to raise engagement among the audience.</dd>
