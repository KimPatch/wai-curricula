### Teaching outline

#### [Lesson]: Stories of people with disabilities

##### Objectives

  * Introducing learners on how people with disabilities use the web. 
  * Raising awareness on the fact that every person uses the web in a different manner.

##### Learning outcomes:
	  * Understanding how individuals with disabilities use the web. 
  * Familiarizing with the needs of such personas when it comes to their usage of web technologies.
  * Understanding the most common barriers and issues that people with disabilities face when navigating the web.

Approximate duration: 3 hours, depending on stories.

##### Contents
  * Stories of people with disabilities - real people with disabilities showing how they use the web in a daily basis. Focus in the following areas of interest, since they will serve you to lay foundations for future knowledge:
    * Different ways of perception (people who are not able to perceive color, images, media content.
    * Different ways of operating with technology (input and output methods): people who do not use the mouse, the keyboard or the screen.
    * Different ways of understanding the web: how people may interact with user interfaces and information.  
    * Different ways  of using technology: how technologies can have distinct ways of interpreting web user interfaces.

##### Suggested teaching methods 
Experiential: Bring people with disabilities and encourage them to explain their daily experience while navigating the web. Whenever possible, use examples that are related to the learner's interests and select web environments that are well-known to learners. If it is not possible to bring people with disabilities, use videos and other types of multimedia content. If video cannot be used either, refer to text-based materials.
